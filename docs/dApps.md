# Decentralized applications (dApps)

One of the main features of blockchains is the _decentralization_: each transaction sent is verified by multiple nodes and its validation process does not rely on a single trusted third party.
Decentralized applications (dApps or Dapps) take advantage of these features to create applications that are independent, transparent, and trustless.

In general, dApps have two parts:

- An on-chain component that consists of one or more smart contracts
- An off-chain component that can act as a user interface to simplify interaction with the on-chain component, run off-chain processing, and get information from the outside world

The off-chain component can be nearly any kind of program, including a web application, mobile or desktop app, or command-line interface.
It relies on wallets to interact with the smart contract on behalf of a user's Tezos account.
