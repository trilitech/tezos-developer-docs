# Architecture

- Who created it and who is in charge of it
- What entities participate in it
- How it is built (architecture, with diagrams)

## Decentralization
## p2p network (introducting nodes, baking)
## smart contracts and dapps
## governance and roadmap for scaling

## goals/inspiration, tiny bit of history
need for decentralization, smart contracts, then for Tezos, need for blockchains to evolve, be environmental friendly, secure
## p2p network, DOS protection, etc.
Idea: to make it more active, create an interactive experience where people simulate playing different roles, through the path of a transaction
## accounts, cryptocurrency, transactions
Here the animation would let people play with transactions ana d simulated wallet
## chain of blocks
idea that for people to agree on a sequence of transactions, they need to be grouped in block, and we create an append-only structure
## baking, consensus mechanism
"someone needs to propose a new block, so we have a system involving bakers, then a mechanism to pick the baker, confirm the block through attestations, and finality
you could have a small interface where you try to create the best block"
## recap: path of a transaction
wallet, simulation, propagation through the nodes, mempool, accepted by a baker, block is propagated and validated, then becomes final, shown as validated on the wallet, and visible by everyone
