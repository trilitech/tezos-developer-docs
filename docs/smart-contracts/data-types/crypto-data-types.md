Tezos provides hash functions for cryptographic purposes.

By default, use `BLAKE2B`, which computes a cryptographic hash of the value contents using the Blake2b-256 cryptographic hash function.

These other hash functions are available:

- `KECCAK`: Compute a cryptographic hash of the value contents using the Keccak-256 cryptographic hash function.
- `SHA256`: Compute a cryptographic hash of the value contents using the Sha256 cryptographic hash function.
- `SHA512`: Compute a cryptographic hash of the value contents using the Sha512 cryptographic hash function.
- `SHA3`: Compute a cryptographic hash of the value contents using the SHA3-256 cryptographic hash function.

## Checking signatures

Tezos lets you check that a given piece of data, a sequence of bytes in a `bytes` data type, has been signed by the holder of the private key corresponding to a given public key.

The primitive `CHECK_SIGNATURE` takes as parameters the sequence of bytes, the `signature` and the `public key`, and returns a Boolean that indicates if the `signature` is indeed a `signature` of that sequence of bytes, by the holder of ths key.

## BLS12-381 primitives

BLS12-381 is the name of an elliptic curve, a cryptographic primitive that can be used for digital `signatures` and zero-knowledge proofs.

It has the particularity of being pairing-friendly, which makes it possible to create short digital `signatures` that can be efficiently aggregated.
It can also be used for identity-based cryptography, single-round multi-party key exchanges, or and efficient polynomial commitment schemes such as KZG commitments.

## Time-locks

A `timelock` is a cryptographic primitive that can be used as part of a commit-and-reveal scheme, to provide a guarantee that the information associated to the commit is eventually revealed.

For information about using time-locks, see [Timelocks](/smart-contracts/timelocks).
