You can write Tezos smart contracts in any of these high-level languages:

- [LIGO](./languages/ligo), which has versions with syntaxes similar to JavaScript/TypeScript and OCaml
- [SmartPy](./languages/smartpy), which has a syntax similar to Python
- [Archetype](./languages/archetype), which is a high-level language developed specifically for Tezos

Each of these languages is eventually compiled to Michelson, the base language for Tezos smart contracts.
That means that the high-level languages have limitations caused by how Michelson works.
For information about Michelson, see [Michelson](./languages/michelson).
