You can write Tezos smart contracts in any of these languages:

- [LIGO](./ligo), which has versions with syntaxes similar to JavaScript/TypeScript and OCaml
- [SmartPy](./smartpy), which has a syntax similar to Python
- [Archetype](./archetype), which is a high-level language developed specifically for Tezos

Each of these languages are eventually compiled to Michelson, the base language for Tezos smart contracts.
For information about Michelson, see [Michelson](./michelson).
