See these pages for information about the data types that Tezos supports:

- [Primitive data types](./data-types/primitive-data-types)
- [Complex data types](./data-types/complex-data-types)
- [Cryptographic data types](./data-types/crypto-data-types)

Higher-level languages may treat data types differently, but they all behave the same way when they are compiled to Michelson and run on Tezos.
