Smart Rollups play a crucial part in providing high scalability on Tezos.
They handle transactions and logic in a separate environment that doesn't need to follow all of the same rules as the main Tezos network.
For this reason, they are not subject to the same block delays and data space constraints as the main Tezos network.

The transactions and logic that Smart Rollups run is called _layer 2_ to differentiate it from the main network, which is called _layer 1_.

The compiled code of a Smart Rollup must be provided publicly, so that anyone can run a Smart Rollup node to execute that code and verify that other nodes are running it correctly, just like anyone can run nodes, bakers, and accusers on layer 1.
This code, called the _kernel_, must behave in a deterministic manner and according to a given semantics, which guarantees that results are reproducible by any rollup node with the same kernel.
The semantics is precisely defined by a reference virtual machine called a proof-generating virtual machine (PVM), able to generate a proof that executing a program in a given context results in a given state.
This guarantees that if a divergence in results is found, it can be tracked down to a single elementary step that was not executed correctly by some node.
In this way, multiple nodes can run the same rollup, and each node can verify the state of the rollup.

For a tutorial on Smart Rollups, see [Deploy a Smart Rollup](../tutorials/smart-rollup).

For reference on Smart Rollups, see [Smart Optimistic Rollups](https://tezos.gitlab.io/active/smart_rollups.html) in the Octez documentation.

This diagram shows a high-level view of how Smart Rollups interact with layer 1:

## Uses for Smart Rollups

- Smart Rollups allow you to run large amounts of processing and manipulate large amounts of data that would be too slow or expensive to run on layer 1.

- Smart Rollups are not constrained to the layer 1 block baking rate and therefore can run far more transactions per second than layer 1.

- Smart Rollups allow you to avoid some transaction fees and storage fees.

- Smart Rollups can retrieve data from outside the blockchain in specific ways that smart contracts can't do.

- Smart Rollups can implement different execution environments, such as execution environments that are compatible with other blockchains.
For example, Smart Rollups enable [Etherlink](https://www.etherlink.com/), which makes it possible to run EVM applications (originally written for Ethereum) on Tezos.

## Communication

Smart Rollups have access to two sources of information: the rollup inbox and the reveal data channel.
These are the only sources of information that rollups can use.
In particular, Smart Rollup nodes cannot communicate directly with each other; they do not have a peer-ro-peer communication channel like layer 1 nodes.

### Rollup inbox

As part of its state, layer 1 has a _rollup inbox_ that contains messages from layer 1 to all rollups.
Anyone can add a message to this inbox and all messages are visible to all rollups.
Smart Rollups filter the inbox to the messages that they are interested in and act on them accordingly.

The messages that users add to the rollup inbox are called _external messages_.
For example, users can add messages to the inbox with the Octez client `send smart rollup message` command.

Similarly, smart contracts can add messages in a way similar to calling a smart contract entrypoint, by using the Michelson `TRANSFER_TOKENS` instruction.
The messages that smart contracts add to the inbox are called _internal messages_.

Each block also contains these internal messages, which are created by the protocol:

- `Start of level`, which indicates the beginning of the block
- `Info per level`, which includes the timestamp and block hash of the preceding block
- `End of level`, which indicates the end of the block

Smart Rollup nodes can use these internal messages to know when blocks begin and end.

### Reveal data channel

Smart Rollups can request arbitrary information through the _reveal data channel_.
Importantly, as opposed to internal and external messages, the information that passes through the reveal data channel does not pass through layer 1, so it is not limited by the bandwidth of layer 1 and can include large amounts of data.

The reveal data channel supports these requests:

- A rollup node can request an arbitrary data page up to 4KB at a time if it knows the blake2b hash of the page, known as _preimage requests_.
To transfer more than 4KB of data, rollups must use multiple pages, which may contain hashes that point to other pages.

- A rollup node can request information about the rollup, including the address and origination level of the rollup, known as _metadata requests_.

{/*
TODO how is this data provided?
Where does it come from?
Do we need instructions on how to provide data?
Eventually include:
  - importing data from a DAC certificate (which can contain anything ultimately, including a kernel to upgrade to)
  - revealing data from the (WIP) DAL
*/}

## Smart Rollup lifecycle

The general flow of a Smart Rollup goes through these phases:

1. Origination: A user originates the Smart Rollup to layer 1 and one or more users start nodes based on that Smart Rollup.
1. Commitment periods: The Smart Rollup nodes receive the messages in the Smart Rollup inbox, run processing based on those messages, and publish a hash of their state at the end of the period.
1. Refutation periods: Nodes can publish a concurrent commitment to refute a published commitment.
1. Triggering outbox messages: After the commitment is cemented, any client can trigger operations from the Smart Rollup.

Here is more information on each of these phases:

{/* TODO diagram of commitment periods and refutation periods? */}

### Origination

Like smart contracts, users deploy Smart Rollups to layer 1 in a process called _origination_.

The origination process stores data about the rollup on layer 1, including:

- An address for the rollup, which starts with `sr1`
- The type of proof-generating virtual machine (PVM) for the rollup, which defines the execution engine of the rollup kernel; currently only the `wasm_2_0_0` PVM is supported
- The code of the rollup, which is a WebAssembly program referred to as the rollup's _kernel_
- The Michelson data type of the messages it receives from layer 1
- The genesis commitment that forms the basis for commitments that rollups nodes publish in the future

After it is originated, anyone can run a Smart Rollup node based on this information.

### Commitment periods

Starting from the rollup origination level, levels are partitioned into _commitment periods_ of 60 consecutive layer 1 blocks.
During each commitment period, the each rollup node receives the messages in the rollup inbox, processes them, and updates its state.

Because Smart Rollup nodes behave in a deterministic manner, their states should all be the same if they have processed the same inbox messages with the same kernel starting from the same origination level.
This state is referred to as the "state of the rollup."

At the end of the commitment period, each rollup node must publish a hash of its state to layer 1, which is called its _commitment_.
Each commitment builds on the previous commitment, and so on, back to the genesis commitment from when the Smart Rollup was originated.

Nodes must stake 10,000 tez along with their commitments.
When nodes make identical commitments, their stakes are combined into a single stake for the commitment.

Then a refutation period for the commitment period begins, and a new commitment period begins.

### Refutation periods

Because the PVM is deterministic and all of the inputs are the same for all nodes, any honest node that runs the same Smart Rollup produces the same commitment.
As long as nodes publish matching commitments, they continue running normally.

During the refutation period for a commitment period, if two or more nodes publish different commitments, two of them play a _refutation game_ to identify the correct commitment.
The nodes automatically play the refutation game by stepping through their logic to identify the point at which they differ.
At this point, layer 1 uses the PVM to identify the correct commitment.
Then the protocol gives half of the incorrect commitment's stake to the correct commitment's stake, and burns the other half.
The protocol eliminates the incorrect commitment or commitments because they have no stake.

This refutation game happens as many times as is necessary to eliminate incorrect commitments.
Because the node that ran the PVM correctly is guaranteed to win the refutation game, a single honest node is enough to ensure that the Smart Rollup is running correctly.
This kind of Smart Rollup is called a Smart Optimistic Rollup because the commitments are assumed to be correct until they are proven wrong by an honest rollup node.

When there is only one commitment left, either because all nodes published identical commitments during the whole refutation period or because this commitment won the refutation games and eliminated all other commitments, then this correct commitment can be _cemented_ by a dedicated layer 1 operation and becomes final and unchangeable.
The commitments for the next commitment period build on this cemented commitment.

The refutation period lasts 2 weeks on Mainnet; it can be different on other networks.

### Triggering outbox messages

Smart Rollups can generate transactions to run on layer 1, but those transactions do not run immediately.
When a commitment includes layer 1 transactions, these transactions go into the Smart Rollup outbox and wait for the commitment to be cemented.

After the commitment is cemented, clients can trigger transactions in the outbox with the Octez `execute outbox message` command.
When they trigger a transaction, it runs like any other call to a smart contract.
For more information, see [Triggering the execution of an outbox message](https://tezos.gitlab.io/shell/smart_rollup_node.html?highlight=triggering) in the Octez documentation.

# Workflows

## Tools

Smart Rollups come with two new executable programs: the Octez rollup
node and the Octez rollup client.

The Octez rollup node is used by a rollup operator to deploy a rollup.
The rollup node is responsible for making the rollup progress by
publishing commitments and by playing refutation games.

Just like the Octez node, the Octez rollup node provides an RPC
interface `RPC <../api/openapi>`. The
services of this interface can be called directly with HTTP requests or
indirectly using the Octez rollup client.

## Prerequisites

An Octez rollup node needs an Octez node to run. We assume that an Octez node has been launched locally:

```sh
octez-node config init --data-dir "${ONODE_DIR}" --network "${NETWORK}"
octez-node run --data-dir "${ONODE_DIR}" --network "${NETWORK}" --rpc-addr 127.0.0.1
```

Finally, you need to check that your balance is greater than 10,000 tez
to make sure that staking is possible. If your balance is not
sufficient, you can get test tokens from a faucet.

```sh
octez-client get balance for "${OPERATOR_ADDR}"
```

## Origination

Anyone can originate a smart rollup with the following invocation of the Octez client:

```sh
octez-client originate smart rollup "${SOR_ALIAS}" \
  from "${OPERATOR_ADDR}" \
  of kind wasm_2_0_0 \
  of type bytes \
  with kernel "${KERNEL}" \
  --burn-cap 999
```

where `${SOR_ALIAS}` is an alias to memorize the smart rollup address in the client. This alias can be used in any command where a smart rollup address is expected. `${KERNEL}` is a hex representation of a WebAssembly bytecode serving as an initial program to boot on.

You can obtain this representation through the WASM bytecode file named `kernel.wasm`:

```sh
xxd -ps -c 0 <kernel.wasm> | tr -d '\n'
```

To experiment, we propose that you use the value `${KERNEL}` defined in the file `sr_boot_kernel.sh`.

```sh
source sr_boot_kernel.sh
```

If everything went well, the origination command results in:

```sh
    This sequence of operations was run:
      Manager signed operations:
        From: tz1fp5ncDmqYwYC568fREYz9iwQTgGQuKZqX

            storage fees ........................... +ꜩ1.638

```

The address `sr1RYurGZtN8KNSpkMcCt9CgWeUaNkzsAfXf` is the smart rollup
address. Let's refer to it as `${SOR_ADDR}` from now on.

## Deploying a rollup node

Now that the rollup is originated, anyone can deploy a rollup node to advance the rollup.

First, we need to decide on a directory where the rollup node stores its data. Let us assign this path to `${ROLLUP_NODE_DIR}`.

The rollup node can be run with:

```sh
octez-smart-rollup-node-alpha --base-dir "${OCLIENT_DIR}" \
                 run operator for "${SOR_ALIAS_OR_ADDR}" \
                 with operators "${OPERATOR_ADDR}" \
                 --data-dir "${ROLLUP_NODE_DIR}"
```

The log should show that the rollup node follows layer 1 chain and is processing the inbox of each level.

:::note Distinct layer 1 Addresses
Distinct layer 1 addresses could be used for layer 1
operations issued by the rollup node simply by editing the configuration file to set different addresses for `publish` `add_messages` `cement` `refute`.
:::


In addition, a rollup node can run under different modes:

1.  `operator` activates a full-fledged rollup node. This means that the
    rollup node will do everything needed to make the rollup progress.
    This includes following layer 1 chain, reconstructing inboxes,
    updating the states, publishing and cementing commitments regularly,
    and playing the refutation games. In this mode, the rollup node will
    accept transactions in its queue and batch them on layer 1.
2.  `batcher` means that the rollup node will accept transactions in its
    queue and batch them on layer 1. In this mode, the rollup node
    follows layer 1 chain, but it does not update its state and does
    not reconstruct inboxes. Consequently, it does not publish
    commitments nor play refutation games.
3.  `observer` means that the rollup node follows layer 1 chain to
    reconstruct inboxes, to update its state. However, it will neither
    publish commitments, nor play a refutation game. It does not include
    the message batching service either.
4.  `maintenance` is the same as the operator mode except that it does
    not include the message batching service.
5.  `accuser` follows the `layer1-chain` and computes commitments but does
    not publish them. Only when a conflicting commitment (published by
    another staker) is detected will the **"accuser node"** publish a
    commitment and participate in the subsequent refutation game.

The following table summarizes the operation modes, focusing on the L1
operations which are injected by the rollup node in each mode.


&nbsp; | Add Messages | Publish | Cement | Refute
---|---|---|---|---
Operator | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes
Batcher | Yes | No | No | No
Observer | No | No | No | No
Maintenance | No | Yes | Yes | Yes
Accuser | No | Yes* | No | Yes

:::note When does an accuser publish commitments?
An accuser node will publish commitments only when it detects conflicts. In this case, it must deposit 10,000 tez.
:::

### Configuration file

The rollup node can also be configured with the following command that
uses the same arguments as the `run` command:

```sh
octez-smart-rollup-node-alpha --base-dir "${OCLIENT_DIR}" \
                 init operator config for "${SOR_ALIAS_OR_ADDR}" \
                 with operators "${OPERATOR_ADDR}" \
                 --data-dir "${ROLLUP_NODE_DIR}"
```

This creates a configuration file at `${ROLLUP_NODE_DIR}/config.json`:

```sh
{
	"data-dir": "${ROLLUP_NODE_DIR}",
	"smart-rollup-address": "${SOR_ADDR}",
	"smart-rollup-node-operator": {
	"publish": "${OPERATOR_ADDR}",
	"add_messages": "${OPERATOR_ADDR}",
	"cement": "${OPERATOR_ADDR}",
	"refute": "${OPERATOR_ADDR}"
	},
	"fee-parameters": {},
	"mode": "operator"
}
```

The rollup node can now be run with:

```sh
octez-smart-rollup-node-alpha -d "${OCLIENT_DIR}" run --data-dir ${ROLLUP_NODE_DIR}
```

The configuration will be read from `${ROLLUP_NODE_DIR}/config.json`.

### Rollup node in a sandbox

The node can also be tested locally with a sandbox environment.

Once you initialized the **sandboxed** client data with:

```sh
./src/bin_client/octez-init-sandboxed-client.sh
```

You can run a sandboxed rollup node with:

```sh
`octez-smart-rollup-node-Pt${CURRENT_PROTOCOL} run`.
```

where `${CURRENT_PROTOCOL}` represents the current latest protocol i.e. `PtMumbai`, `PtNairob` etc.

A temporary directory `/tmp/tezos-smart-rollup-node.xxxxxxxx` will be
used. However, a specific data directory can be set with the environment variable `SCORU_DATA_DIR`.

## Sending an External Inbox Message

The Octez client can be used to send an external message into the rollup inbox. Assuming that `${EMESSAGE}` is the hexadecimal representation of the message payload, to inject an external message, run:

```sh
octez-client" -d "${OCLIENT_DIR}" -p Pt${CURRENT_PROTOCOL} \
 send smart rollup message "hex:[ \"${EMESSAGE}\" ]" \
 from "${OPERATOR_ADDR}"
```

Let's now produce some viable contents for `${EMESSAGE}`. The kernel used previously in our running example is a simple "echo" kernel that copies its input as a new message to its outbox. Therefore, the input must be a valid binary encoding of an outbox message to make this work.

Specifically, assuming that we have originated a layer 1 smart contract as follows:

```sh
octez-client -d "${OCLIENT_DIR}" -p Pt${CURRENT_PROTOCOL} \
  originate contract go transferring 1 from "${OPERATOR_ADDR}" \
  running 'parameter string; storage string; code {CAR; NIL operation; PAIR};' \
  --init '""' --burn-cap 0.4
```

and that this contract is identified by a address `${CONTRACT}`, then
one can encode an outbox transaction using the Octez rollup client as
follows:

```sh
MESSAGE='[ { \
  "destination" : "${CONTRACT}", \
  "parameters" : "\"Hello world\"", \
  "entrypoint" : "%default" } ]'

EMESSAGE=$(octez-smart-rollup-client-Pt${CURRENT_PROTOCOL} encode outbox message "${MESSAGE}")
```

## Triggering Execution of an Outbox Message

Once an outbox message has been pushed to the outbox by the kernel at
some level `${L}`, the user needs to wait for the commitment that includes this level to be cemented. On Dailynet, the cementation process
of a non-disputed commitment is 40 blocks long while on Mainnet, it is 2
weeks long.

When the commitment is cemented, one can observe that the outbox is
populated as follows:

```sh
octez-smart-rollup-client-Pt${CURRENT_PROTOCOL} rpc get \
  /global/block/cemented/outbox/${L}/messages
```

Here is the output for this command:

```
[ { "outbox_level": ${L}, "message_index": "0",
 "message":
   { "transactions":
       [ { "parameters": { "string": "Hello world" },
           "destination": "${CONTRACT}",
           "entrypoint": "%default" } ] } } ]
```

At this point, the actual execution of a given outbox message can be
triggered. This requires precomputing a proof that this outbox message
is indeed in the outbox. In the case of our running example, this proof
is retrieved as follows:

```sh
PROOF=$(octez-smart-rollup-client-Pt${CURRENT_PROTOCOL} get proof for message 0 \
  of outbox at level "${L}" \
  transferring "${MESSAGE}")
```

Finally, the execution of the outbox message is done as follows:

```sh
"${TEZOS_PATH}/octez-client" -d "${OCLIENT_DIR}" -p Pt${CURRENT_PROTOCOL} \
        execute outbox message of smart rollup "${SOR_ALIAS_OR_ADDR}" \
        from "${OPERATOR_ADDR}" for commitment hash "${LCC}" \
        and output proof "${PROOF}"
```

where `${LCC}` is the hash of the latest cemented commitment.

:::note Who can trigger the execution of an outbox message?
Anyone can trigger the execution of an outbox message (not only an
operator).

To check the contract has indeed been called with the parameter `Hello World` through an internal operation, we can check the receipt. More complex parameters, typically assets represented as tickets,
can be used as long as they match the type of the entrypoint of the
destination smart contract.

## Sending An Internal Inbox Message

A smart contract can push an internal message in the rollup inbox using
the Michelson `TRANSFER_TOKENS` instruction targeting a specific rollup
address. The parameter of this transfer must be a value of the Michelson type declared at the origination of this rollup.

Remember that our running example rollup has been originated with:

```sh
octez-client originate smart rollup "${SOR_ALIAS}" \
  from "${OPERATOR_ADDR}" \
  of kind wasm_2_0_0 \
  of type bytes \
  booting with "${KERNEL}" \
  -burn-cap 999
```

The fragment `of type bytes` declares that the rollup is expecting values of type `bytes`. Any Michelson type could have been used. To transfer tickets to a rollup, this type must
mention tickets.

Here is an example of a Michelson script that sends an internal message
to the rollup of our running example. The payload of the internal
message is the value passed as parameter of type `bytes` to the rollup.

```sh
parameter bytes;
storage unit;
code
	{
		UNPAIR;
		PUSH address "${SOR_ADDR}";
		CONTRACT bytes;
		IF_NONE { PUSH string "Invalid address"; FAILWITH } {};
		PUSH mutez 0;
		DIG 2;
		TRANSFER_TOKENS;
		NIL operation;
		SWAP;
		CONS;
		PAIR;
	}
```

## Populating the Reveal Channel

It is the responsibility of rollup node operators to provide the data passed through the reveal data channel when the rollup requests it.

To answer a request for a page of hash `H`, the rollup node tries to
read the content of a file `H` named `${ROLLUP_NODE_DIR}/wasm_2_0_0`.

Notice that a page cannot exceed 4KB. Hence, larger pieces of data must
be represented with multiple pages that reference each other through
hashes. It is up to the kernel to decide how to implement this. For
instance, one can classify pages into two categories: index pages that
are hashes for other pages and leaf pages that contain actual payloads.

## Configure WebAssembly Fast Execution

When the rollup node advances its internal rollup state under normal
operation, it does so in a mode called `Fast Execution`.

This mode uses [Wasmer](https://wasmer.io) when running WebAssembly code which allows you to configure the compiler it will use to deal with the WebAssembly code. It can be done using the `OCTEZ_WASMER_COMPILER` environment variable which will be picked up by the smart rollup node.

The performance of the WebAssembly execution is affected primarily by the choice of compiler. Some compilers offer additional security guarantees which might be attractive to you.

Here are some compiler options:

Compiler | `OCTEZ_WASMER_COMPILER` | Description
--- | --- | ---
Singlepass | `singlepass` | [When to use Singlepass](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer/tree/master/lib/compiler-singlepass#when-to-use-singlepass) |
Cranelift | `cranelift` | [When to use Cranelift](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer/tree/master/lib/compiler-cranelift#when-to-use-cranelift)

## Developing WASM Kernels

A rollup is primarily characterized by the semantics given to the
input messages it processes. These semantics are provided at origination time as a WASM program (i.e. `wasm_2_0_0`) called a
**kernel**. The kernel is a WASM module encoded in the binary format as defined by the WASM standard.

A key requirement for any web3 technology is determinism. To ensure determinism, the following restrictions are in place:

1.  Instructions and types related to floating-point arithmetic are not
    supported. This is because IEEE floats are not deterministic, as the
    standard includes undefined behavior operations.
2.  The length of the call stack of the WASM kernel is restricted to
    300.

Otherwise, we support the full WASM language. A valid kernel is a WASM module that satisfies the following constraints:

1.  It exports a function `kernel_run` that takes no argument and
    returns nothing.
2.  It declares and exports exactly one memory.
3.  It only imports the host functions exported by the (virtual) module
    `smart_rollup_core`.

For instance, an example of a simple `Hello World` kernel is the
following WASM program in text format.

```sh
(module
  (import "smart_rollup_core" "write_debug"
     (func $write_debug (param i32 i32) (result i32)))
  (memory 1)
  (export "mem" (memory 0))
  (data (i32.const 100) "hello, world!")
  (func (export "kernel_run")
    (local $hello_address i32)
    (local $hello_length i32)
    (local.set $hello_address (i32.const 100))
    (local.set $hello_length (i32.const 13))
    (drop (call $write_debug (local.get $hello_address)
                             (local.get $hello_length)))))
```

This program can be compiled to the WASM binary format with
general-purpose tool like [WABT](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt).

```sh
wat2wasm hello.wat -o hello.wasm
```

The contents of the resulting `hello.wasm` file is a valid WASM kernel. One of the benefits of choosing WASM as the programming language for Smart Rollups is that WASM has gradually become a ubiquitous compilation target over the years. Its popularity has grown to the point where mainstream, industrial languages like Go or Rust now natively compile to WASM. For example, `cargo`, the official Rust package manager, provides an official target to compile Rust to `.wasm` binary files, which are valid WASM kernels. This means that, for this particular example, one can build a WASM kernel while enjoying the strengths and convenience of the Rust language and the Rust ecosystem.

In the context of Smart Rollups, Rust has become the primary language where the WASM backend has been tested extensively. However, the WASM VM has not been modified in any way to favor this language. We fully expect that other mainstream languages, such as Go, are also great candidates for implementing WASM kernels.

Let's move on and continue by:

1.  explaining the execution environment of a WASM kernel i.e. when it is parsed, executed, etc.
2.  explaining, in detail, the API at the disposal of WASM kernel developers.
3.  demonstrating how Rust can be used to implement a WASM kernel.

### Execution Environment

Fundamentally, the life cycle of a smart rollup is a never-ending loop
of fetching inputs from layer 1, and executing the `kernel_run` function exposed by the WASM kernel.

### State

The smart rollup carries two states:

1.  A transient state, that is reset after each call to the `kernel_run` function, similar to RAM.
2.  A persistent state, that is preserved across `kernel_run` calls.
       - The **inbox** possesses this persistent state which is regularly populated with the inputs coming from layer 1.
       -  The **outbox** which the kernel can populate with contract calls targeting smart contracts in layer 1. This can be thought of as durable storage similar to a file system.


The durable storage is a persistent tree, whose contents is addressed by path-like keys.

A path in the storage may contain:
- a value (also called file) consisting of a sequence of raw bytes
- and/or any number of subtrees (also called directories) i.e. the paths in the storage prefixed by the current path.

Thus, unlike most file systems, a path in the durable storage may be at the same time a file and a directory (a set of sub-paths).

The WASM kernel can write and read the raw bytes stored under a given
path (the file), but can also interact (delete, copy, move, etc.) with
subtrees (directories).

:::note Read-only values and subtrees
The values and subtrees under the key `/readonly` are not writable by a
kernel, but can be used by the PVM to give information to the kernel.
:::

### Control Flow

When a new block is published on Tezos, the inbox exposed to the smart
rollup is populated with all the inputs published on Tezos in this
block. Keep in mind that all Smart Rollups which are originated on Tezos share the same inbox. As a consequence, a WASM kernel has to filter the inputs that are relevant for its purpose from the ones it does not need to process.

Once the inbox has been populated with the inputs of the Tezos block,
the `kernel_run` function is called, from a clean `transient` state.
More precisely, the WASM kernel is re-initialized, then `kernel_run` is
called.

By default, the WASM kernel yields when `kernel_run` returns. In this case:

- The WASM kernel execution is put on hold while the inputs of the next inbox are loaded.
- The inputs that were not consumed by `kernel_run` are dropped
- `kernel_run` can prevent the WASM kernel from yielding by writing arbitrary data under the path `/kernel/env/reboot`
in its durable storage.
-  In such a case (known as `reboot`), `kernel_run` is called again, without dropping unread inputs.
- The value at `/kernel/env/reboot` is removed between each call of `kernel_run`, and the `kernel_run` function can maximally postpone yielding 1,000 reboots for each Tezos level.

A call to `kernel_run` cannot take an arbitrary amount of time to
complete, because diverging computations are not compatible with the
optimistic rollup infrastructure of Tezos. To dodge the halting problem, the reference interpreter of WASM (used during the refutation game) enforces a bound on the number of ticks used in a call to `kernel_run`. Once the maximum number of ticks is reached, the execution of `kernel_run` is trapped (*i.e.*, interrupted with an error). In turn, the fast execution engine does not enforce this time limit. Hence, it is the responsibility of the kernel developer to implement a `kernel_run` which does not exceed its tick budget.

The current bound is set to 11,000,000,000 ticks.
`octez-smart-rollup-wasm-debugger` is the best tool available
to verify the `kernel_run` function does not go over this tick limit.

The direct consequence of this setup is that it might be necessary for a WASM kernel to span a long computation across several calls to
`kernel_run`, requiring serialization of any data it needs in the
durable storage to avoid loss.

Finally, the kernel can verify if the previous `kernel_run` invocation
was trapped by verifying if some data are stored under the path `kernel/env/stuck`.

### Host Functions

At its core, the WASM machine defined in the WASM standard is an
evolved arithmetic machine. It needs to be enriched with so-called
"host" functions to be used for greater purposes. The host
functions provide an API to the WASM program to interact externally.

For Smart Rollups, the host functions exposed to a WASM kernel allow
it to interact with the components of persistent state:

 - `read_input` - loads the oldest input still present in the inbox of the smart rollup in the transient memory of the WASM kernel. This means that the input is lost at the next invocation of `kernel_run` if it is not written in the durable storage

- `write_output` - writes an in-memory buffer to the outbox of the smart rollup. If the content of the buffer follows the expected encoding, it can be interpreted within layer 1 as a smart contract call, once a commitment acknowledging the call to this host function is cemented

- `write_debug` - can be used by the WASM kernel to log events which can potentially be interpreted by an instrumented rollup node

- `store_has` - returns the kind of data (if any) stored in the durable storage under a given path: a directory, a file, neither or both

- `store_delete` - cuts the subtree out (via a given path) from the durable storage

- `store_copy` - copies the subtree (via a given path) to another key.

- `store_move` - behaves as `store_copy`, but also cuts the original subtree out of the tree.

- `store_read` - loads at most 2048 bytes from a file in the durable storage to a buffer in the memory of the WASM kernel.

- `store_write` - writes at most 2048 bytes from a buffer in the memory of the WASM kernel to a file of the durable storage, increasing its size if necessary. Note that files in the durable storage cannot exceed $$2^{31} - 1$$ bytes, (i.e. 2GB - 1).

- `store_value_size` - returns the size (in bytes) of a file under a given key in the durable storage.

- `store_list_size` - returns the number of child objects (either directories or files) under a given key.

`reveal_preimage` - loads in memory the preimage of a hash. The size of the hash in bytes must be specified as an input to the function.

`reveal_metadata` - loads in memory the address of the smart rollup (20 bytes), and the Tezos level of its origination (4 bytes).

These host functions use a "C-like" API. In particular, most of them
return a signed 32bit integer, where negative values are reserved for
conveying errors, as shown in the next table.


Code | Description
--- | ---
` > -1` | Input is too large to be a valid key of the durable storage
` > -2` | Input cannot be parsed as a valid key of the durable storage
` > -3` | There is no file under the requested key
` > -4` | The host functions tried to read or write an invalid section (determined by an offset and a length) of the value stored under a given key
` > -5` | Cannot write a value beyond the 2GB size limit
` > -6` | Invalid memory access (segmentation fault)
` > -7` | Tried to read from the inbox or write to the outbox more than 4,096 bytes
` > -8` | Unknown error due to an invalid access
` > -9` | Attempt to modify a readonly value
` > -10` | Key has no tree in the storage
` > -11` | Outbox is full, no new message can be appended


## Implementing a WASM Kernel in Rust

:::note Rust Familiarity
This document is not a tutorial about Rust. Familiarity with the
language and its ecosystem (in particular, how Rust crates are structured) is assumed.
:::

Though WASM is a good fit for efficiently executing computation-intensive, arbitrary programs, it is a low-level,
stack-based, memory unsafe language. Fortunately, it was designed to be
a compilation target, not a language in which developers would directly
write their programs.

Rust has several advantages that makes it a good candidate for writing
the kernel of a smart rollup. Not only does the Rust compiler treat WASM as a first class citizen when it comes to compilation targets, but its approach to memory safety eliminates large classes of bugs and
vulnerabilities that arbitrary WASM programs may suffer from.

### Setting-up Rust

[rustup](https://rustup.rs) is the standard way to get Rust. Once
`rustup` is installed, enabling WASM as a compilation target is as
simple as running the following command.

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Rust also proposes the `wasm64-unknown-unknown` compilation target. This target is **not** compatible with Tezos Smart Rollups, which only
provides a 32bit address space.

The simplest kernel one can implement in Rust (the one that returns directly after being called, without specification) is the following Rust file (by convention named `lib.rs` in Rust).

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn kernel_run() {
}
```

This code can be easily computed with `cargo` with the following
`Cargo.toml`.

```toml
[package]
name = 'noop'
version = '0.1.0'
edition = '2021'

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
```

The key line to spot is the `crate-type` definition to `cdylib`. When writing a library that will eventually be consumed by a Kernel WASM crate, this line must be modified to:

```toml
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]
```

Compiling our "noop" kernel is done by calling `cargo` with the correct
argument:

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

It is also possible to use the `--release` CLI flag to tell `cargo` to
optimize the kernel. To make the use of the `target` optional, it is possible to create a `.cargo/config.toml` file, containing the following line.

```toml
[build]
target = "wasm32-unknown-unknown"

[rust]
lld = true%
```

The resulting project looks as follows.

```sh
.
├── .cargo
│   └── config.toml
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
└── lib.rs
```

and the kernel can be found in the `target/` directory `./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/noop.wasm`.

By default, Rust binaries (including WASM binaries) contain a lot of
debugging information and possibly unused code that we do not want to
deploy in our rollup. For instance, our `noop` kernel is 1.7MBytes. We can use [wasm-strip](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt) to reduce
the size of the kernel down to 115 bytes in this case.

### Host Functions in Rust

The host functions exported by the WASM runtime to Rust programs are
exposed by the API below. The `link` pragma is used to specify the
module that exports them (in our case, `smart_rollup_core`).

```rust
#[repr(C)]
pub struct ReadInputMessageInfo {
    pub level: i32,
    pub id: i32,
}

#[link(wasm_import_module = "smart_rollup_core")]
extern "C" {
    /// Returns the number of bytes written to `dst`, or an error code.
    pub fn read_input(
        message_info: *mut ReadInputMessageInfo,
        dst: *mut u8,
        max_bytes: usize,
    ) -> i32;

    /// Returns 0 in case of success, or an error code.
    pub fn write_output(src: *const u8, num_bytes: usize) -> i32;

    /// Does nothing. Does not check the correctness of its argument.
    pub fn write_debug(src: *const u8, num_bytes: usize);

    /// Returns
    /// - 0 the key is missing
    /// - 1 only a file is stored under the path
    /// - 2 only directories under the path
    /// - 3 both a file and directories
    pub fn store_has(path: *const u8, path_len: usize) -> i32;

    /// Returns 0 in case of success, or an error code
    pub fn store_delete(path: *const u8, path_len: usize) -> i32;

    /// Returns the number of children (file and directories) under a
    /// given key.
    pub fn store_list_size(path: *const u8, path_len: usize) -> i64;

    /// Returns 0 in case of success, or an error code.
    pub fn store_copy(
        src_path: *const u8,
        scr_path_len: usize,
        dst_path: *const u8,
        dst_path_len: usize,
    ) -> i32;

    /// Returns 0 in case of success, or an error code.
    pub fn store_move(
        src_path: *const u8,
        scr_path_len: usize,
        dst_path: *const u8,
        dst_path_len: usize,
    ) -> i32;

    /// Returns the number of bytes written to the durable storage
    /// (should be equal to `num_bytes`, or an error code.
    pub fn store_read(
        path: *const u8,
        path_len: usize,
        offset: usize,
        dst: *mut u8,
        num_bytes: usize,
    ) -> i32;

    /// Returns 0 in case of success, or an error code.
    pub fn store_write(
        path: *const u8,
        path_len: usize,
        offset: usize,
        src: *const u8,
        num_bytes: usize,
    ) -> i32;

    /// Returns the number of bytes written at `dst`, or an error
    /// code.
    pub fn reveal_metadata(
        dst: *mut u8,
        max_bytes: usize,
    ) -> i32;

    /// Returns the number of bytes written at `dst`, or an error
    /// code.
    pub fn reveal_preimage(
        hash_addr: *const u8,
        hash_size: u8,
        dst: *mut u8,
        max_bytes: usize,
    ) -> i32;
}
```

These functions are marked as `unsafe` for Rust. It is possible to
provide a safe API on top of them. For instance, the `read_input` host
function can be used to declare a safe function which allocates a fresh
Rust Vector to receive the input.

```rust
// Assuming the host functions are defined in a module `host`.

pub const MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE: u32 = 4096u32;

pub struct Input {
    pub level: u32,
    pub id: u32,
    pub payload: Vec<u8>,
}

pub fn next_input() -> Option<Input> {
    let mut payload = Vec::with_capacity(MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE as usize);

    // Placeholder values
    let mut message_info = ReadInputMessageInfo { level: 0, id: 0 };

    let size = unsafe {
         host::read_input(
            &mut message_info,
            payload.as_mut_ptr(),
            MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE,
        )
    };

    if 0 < payload.len() {
        unsafe { payload.set_len(size as usize) };
        Some(Input {
            level: message_info.level as u32,
            id: message_info.id as u32,
            payload,
        })
    } else {
        None
    }
}
```

Coupling `Vec::with_capacity` along with the `set_len` unsafe function
is a good approach to avoid initializing the 4,096 bytes of memory every time you want to load data of arbitrary size into the WASM memory.

### Testing your Kernel

:::note Smart Rollup WASM Debugger
`octez-smart-rollup-wasm-debugger` is available in the Octez
distribution starting with `/releases/version-16`.
:::


Testing a kernel without having to start a rollup node on a test network is very convenient. We provide a debugger as a means to evaluate the WASM PVM without relying on any node and network:

```sh
octez-smart-rollup-wasm-debugger "${WASM_FILE}" --inputs "${JSON_INPUTS}" --rollup "${SOR_ADDR}"
```

`octez-smart-rollup-wasm-debugger` takes as its argument the WASM kernel to be debugged, either a `.wasm` file (the binary representation of WebAssembly modules) or as a `.wast` file (its textual representation) and actually parses and typechecks the kernel before giving it to the PVM.

Beside the kernel file, the debugger can optionally take an input file
containing inboxes and a rollup address. The expected contents of the
inboxes is a JSON value, with the following schema:

```json
[
  [ { "payload" : <Michelson data>,
      "sender" : <Contract hash of the originated contract for the rollup, optional>,
      "source" : <Implicit account sending the message, optional>
      "destination" : <Smart rollup address> }
    ..
    // or
    { "external" : <hexadecimal payload> }
    ..
  ]
]
```

The contents of the input file is a JSON array of arrays of inputs,
which encodes a sequence of inboxes, where an inbox is a set of
messages. These inboxes are read in the same order as they appear in the JSON file.

For example, here is a valid input file that defines two inboxes: the first array encodes an inbox containing only an external message, while the second array encodes an inbox containing two messages:

```json
[
  [
    {
      "external":
      "0000000023030b01d1a37c088a1221b636bb5fccb35e05181038ba7c000000000764656661756c74"
    }
  ],
  [
    {
      "payload" : "0",
      "sender" : "KT1ThEdxfUcWUwqsdergy3QnbCWGHSUHeHJq",
      "source" : "tz1RjtZUVeLhADFHDL8UwDZA6vjWWhojpu5w",
      "destination" : "sr1RYurGZtN8KNSpkMcCt9CgWeUaNkzsAfXf"
    },
    { "payload" : "Pair Unit False" }
  ]
]
```

Note that the `sender`, `source` and `destination` fields are optional
and will be given default values by the debugger, respectively:

- `KT18amZmM5W7qDWVt2pH6uj7sCEd3kbzLrHT`
- `tz1Ke2h7sDdakHJQh8WX4Z372du1KChsksyU`
- `sr163Lv22CdE8QagCwf48PWDTquk6isQwv57`

If no input file is given, the inbox will be assumed empty. If the option `--rollup` is given, it replaces the default value for the rollup address.

`octez-smart-rollup-wasm-debugger` is a debugger, as such it waits for
user inputs to continue its execution. Its initial state is exactly the
same as right after its origination. Its current state can be inspected
with the command `show status`:

```sh
> show status
Status: Waiting for inputs
Internal state: Collect
```

When started, the kernel is in collection mode internally. This means
that it is not executing any WASM code, and is waiting for inputs in
order to proceed. The command `load inputs` will load the first inbox
from the file given with the option `--inputs`, putting `Start_of_level` and `Info_per_level` before these inputs and `End_of_level` after the inputs.

```sh
> load inputs
Loaded 3 inputs at level 0

> show status
Status: Evaluating
Internal state: Snapshot
```

The internal input buffer can be inspected with `show inbox`:

```sh
> show inbox
Inbox has 3 messages:
{ raw_level: 0;
  counter: 0
  payload: Start_of_level }
{ raw_level: 0;
  counter: 1
  payload: 0000000023030b01d1a37c088a1221b636bb5fccb35e05181038ba7c000000000764656661756c74 }
{ raw_level: 0;
  counter: 2
  payload: End_of_level }
```

The first input of an inbox at the beginning of a level is
`Start_of_level`, and is represented by the message `\000\001` on the
kernel side. We can now start a `kernel_run` evaluation:

```sh
> step kernel_run
Evaluation took 11000000000 ticks so far
Status: Waiting for inputs
Internal state: Collect
```

The memory of the interpreter is flushed between two `kernel_run` calls
(at the `Snapshot` and `Collect` internal states), however the durable
storage can be used as a persistent memory. Let's assume this kernel
wrote data at key `/store/key`:

```sh
> show key /store/key
`<hexadecimal value of the key>`
```

Since the representation of values is decided by the kernel, the
debugger can only return its raw value. Please note that the command
`show keys <path>` will return the keys for the given path. This can
help you navigate in the durable storage.

```sh
> show keys /store
/key
/another_key
...
```

It is also possible to inspect the memory by stopping the PVM before its snapshot internal state, with `step result`, and inspect the memory at pointer `n` and length `l`, and finally evaluate until the next `kernel_run`:

```sh
> step result
Evaluation took 2500 ticks so far
Status: Evaluating
Internal state: Evaluation succeeded

> show memory at p for l bytes
`<hexadecimal value>`

> step kernel_run
Evaluation took 7500 ticks so far
Status: Evaluating
Internal state: Snapshot
```

Once again, note that values from the memory are output as is, since the representation is internal to WASM.

Finally, it is possible to evaluate the whole inbox with `step inbox`.
It will take care of the possible reboots asked by the kernel (through
the usage of the `/kernel/env/reboot_flag` flag) and stop at the next
collection phase:

```sh
> step inbox
Evaluation took 44000000000 ticks
Status: Waiting for inputs
Internal state: Collect
```

It is also possible to show the outbox for any given level:

```sh
> show outbox at level 0
Outbox has N messages:
{ unparsed_parameters: ..;
  destination: ..;
  entrypoint: ..; }
..
```

The reveal channel described previously is available in the debugger,
either automatically or through specific commands. The debugger can automatically fill preimages from files in a specific directory on the disk, by default in the `preimage` subdirectory of the working directory. It can be configured with the option `--preimage-dir <directory>`.

In case there is no corresponding file found for the requested preimage, the debugger will ask for the hexadecimal value of the preimage:

```sh
> step inbox
Preimage for hash 0000[..] not found.
> 48656c6c6f207468657265210a
Hello there!
...
```

Metadata is automatically filled with level `0` as origination level
and the configured smart rollup address (or the default one).

Note that when stepping tick by tick (using the `step tick` command), it is possible to end up in a situation were the evaluation stops on
`Waiting for reveal`. If the expected value is a metadata, the command
`reveal metadata` will give the default metadata to the kernel. If the
value expected is the preimage of a given hash, there are two possible
solutions:

-   `reveal preimage` - read the value from the disk. In that case, the
    debugger will look for a file of the same name as the expected hash
    in the `preimage` subdirectory.
-   `reveal preimage of <hex encoded value>` - used to feed a
    custom preimage hash.

## Glossary

-  **PVM**: A Proof-generating Virtual Machine is a reference
    implementation for a device on top of which a smart rollup can be
    executed. This reference implementation is part of the Tezos
    protocol and is the unique source of truth regarding the semantics
    of rollups. The PVM is able to produce proofs enforcing this truth.
    This ability is used during the final step of refutation games.
-  **Inbox**: A sequence of messages from layer 1 to Smart Rollups.
    The contents of the inbox is determined by the consensus of the
    Tezos protocol.
-  **Outbox**: A sequence of messages from a smart rollup to
    layer 1. Messages are smart contract calls, potentially containing
    tickets. These calls can be triggered only when the related
    commitment is cemented (hence, at least two weeks after the actual
    execution of the operation).
-  **Commitment period**: A period of 60 blocks during which all inbox
    messages must be processed by the rollup node state to compute a
    commitment. A commitment must be published for each commitment
    period.
-  **Refutation period**: At the end of each commitment period, a
    period of two weeks starts to allow any commitment related to this
    commitment period to be challenged.
-  **Staker**: An implicit account that has made a deposit on a
    commitment.
-  **Refutation game**: A process by which the Tezos protocol solves a
    conflict between two stakers.
