Like other blockchains, Tezos relies on a native token in which transaction fees are paid.
The native token of Tezos is tez (also known as XTZ or represented by the symbol êœ©).

Tezos is also used as a platform for owning and exchanging various types of NFTs, including fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Tezos also offers a built-in abstraction called tickets, which are fungible tokens that can be created by smart contracts in limited quantity (possibly only one), but whose ownership are directly tracked by the blockchain.

To start right away using tokens, see these tutorials:

## Token standards

Tezos provides standards for common token types; see [Token standards](../developing/token-standards).
