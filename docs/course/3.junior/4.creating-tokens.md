# Interactive: Creating tokens

It's time for you to create your own tokens on Tezos.
The tutorial [Build an NFT marketplace](https://docs.tezos.com/docs/tutorials/build-an-nft-marketplace/) guides you through creating different kinds of tokens that are compatible with the FA2 standard, including:

- NFTs
- Fungible tokens
- Multiple collections of fungible tokens in the same contract

In the tutorial, you will use what you have learned about tokens and data storage to create a marketplace that allows people to create, buy, and sell tokens on a web application.
The tutorial uses a template for the tokens so all tokens you create are FA2-compliant.

At the end of the tutorial, you will have a complete dApp, including a smart contract and a web application:
