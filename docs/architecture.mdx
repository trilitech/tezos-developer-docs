The Tezos network is composed of many Tezos nodes running different jobs with the overall goal of maintaining the state of the data in its blockchain in a decentralized manner.

This diagram shows a high-level view of the Tezos system:

## Components

These are the main components of Tezos:

- The data of the chain itself
- The nodes that store the chain data, accept transactions to add to the chain, and verify transactions that other nodes add to the chain
- The clients that send transactions to the nodes

### The blockchain data

Although people often use the word "blockchain" to mean the entire system, strictly speaking, a Tezos blockchain is a series of blocks of data, each connected to a previous block in the chain.
Tezos has a primary blockchain, referred to as Mainnet, and a group of blockchains used for testing, referred to as testnets.
Anyone can create a new blockchain in the Tezos system, so nodes reach consensus on which blockchain is the primary one and which block should be the next block in any specific blockchain.

Technically speaking, there can be many slightly different copies of each blockchain.
When one node adds a block, its copy of the blockchain becomes slightly different from that of other nodes that haven't heard about the new block yet.
Also, a node might add an invalid block that other nodes would challenge and refuse to add to their copies of the blockchain.
In this way, the Tezos consensus mechanism resolves short-term differences and keeps nodes in long-term agreement about the state of the blockchain.

The data inside a Tezos block includes operations such as transferring tez between accounts, calling smart contracts, and adding messages to the smart rollup inbox.

### Nodes

Tezos nodes are computers that store and manage the state of a blockchain.

The main types of Tezos nodes are:

- Baking nodes, which bake new blocks and send them to other nodes

  In addition to baking new blocks, baking nodes are responsible for storing a copy of the current state of the blockchain data, known as the _context_.
  When they receive a new block from another node, they run each operation in the block, such as tez transfers and calls to smart contracts,  and compute the new state of the context.

  Baking nodes are also responsible for communication with other nodes via a peer-to-peer network.
  Nodes communicate over this P2P network, also called the _gossip network_, to exchange new blocks and operations.

- Accuser nodes, which verify the blocks that other nodes bake and challenge blocks that have problems

  The accuser monitors new blocks and looks for problems, such as when bakers try to add more than one block at a time.
  When it finds a problem, it submits a denunciation to other nodes to refuse the new blocks and punish the offending node.

- Smart Rollup nodes, which run logic on a layer that is separate from the main Tezos baking process

Anyone can run a node and choose which node functions to run.
Because different programs control functions such as baking blocks and challenging other nodes' blocks, your nodes can choose which programs to run.

### Clients

Many clients can add operations to the network of nodes, including:

- Web applications
- Command-line applications such as the [Octez client](../developing/octez-client/)
- Wallet applications
- Applications that use SDKs such as [Taquito](../dApps/taquito)

When a client adds an operation, that new operation becomes part of the _mempool_, which is a list of available operations.
Nodes share operations with each other, so the node that bakes an operation into a block may not be the node that the client sent the operation to.

## Layers

Tezos runs transactions on two layers:

- Baking nodes run transactions on Tezos layer 1, which is the primary layer and the layer that most people mean when they talk about Tezos and transactions.

- Smart Rollup nodes run transactions and logic in a separate environment that doesn't need to follow all of the same rules as layer 1.
The transactions and logic that Smart Rollups run is called layer 2.

For example, Smart Rollups can run transactions at a much higher rate than layer 1 does.
Also, they can run large amounts of processing and handle large amounts of data that would be impractical on layer 1.
Smart Rollups regularly publish their state to layer 1 for nodes to verify.

Separating logic into layers like this allows Tezos to scale to run large amounts of transactions.
Smart Rollups can receive messages from layer 1 and use the information in the messages to run large processing operations independently of layer 1.

For more information about Smart Rollups, see [Smart Optimistic Rollups](./architecture/smart-rollups) and the tutorial [Deploy a smart rollup](./tutorials/smart-rollup).

### Communication between layers

As shown in the diagram above, each layer 1 block has a global rollups inbox that contains messages from layer 1 to all rollups.
Anyone can add a message to this inbox and all messages are available to all rollups.
Rollups receive this inbox, filter it to the messages that they are interested in, and act on them accordingly.

Smart Rollups can send messages back to layer 1 by adding them to their outbox, which consists of calls to smart contracts on layer 1.

Smart Rollups also have access to the _reveal data channel_, which lets them request data from sources outside the inbox.
This channel lets rollups access large amounts of data without having to store it on layer 1.

- What entities participate in it
- How it is built (architecture, with diagrams)

## Decentralization
## p2p network (introducting nodes, baking)
## smart contracts and dapps
## governance and roadmap for scaling

## p2p network, DOS protection, etc.
Idea: to make it more active, create an interactive experience where people simulate playing different roles, through the path of a transaction
## accounts, cryptocurrency, transactions
Here the animation would let people play with transactions and a simulated wallet
## chain of blocks
idea that for people to agree on a sequence of transactions, they need to be grouped in block, and we create an append-only structure
## baking, consensus mechanism
"someone needs to propose a new block, so we have a system involving bakers, then a mechanism to pick the baker, confirm the block through attestations, and finality
you could have a small interface where you try to create the best block"
## recap: path of a transaction
wallet, simulation, propagation through the nodes, mempool, accepted by a baker, block is propagated and validated, then becomes final, shown as validated on the wallet, and visible by everyone
