The Octez command-line client is part of the Octez suite of tools for interacting with Tezos and running nodes.
Developers use the Octez client for many tasks, including:

- Working with accounts
- Sending transactions and interacting with contracts
- Originating smart contracts and Smart Rollups

Other parts of Octez allow you to host, manage, and monitor nodes, bake blocks, and host RPC nodes.

This documentation is an overview of the Octez client for Tezos smart contract and dApp developers.
