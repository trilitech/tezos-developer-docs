Now that you have a layer 1 node and a DAL node, you can run a baking daemon that can create blocks and attests to DAL data.
If you already have a baking daemon, you can restart it to connect to the DAL node.

1. Optional: Set up a remote signer to secure the keys that the baker uses as described in [Signer](https://tezos.gitlab.io/user/key-management.html#signer) in the Octez documentation.

1. Run a baking daemon with the following arguments:

   - Use the consensus key, not the baker key, if you are using a consensus key
   - Pass the URL to your DAL node with the `--dal-node` argument
   - Pass the `--liquidity-baking-toggle-vote` argument; for more information, see [Liquidity baking](https://tezos.gitlab.io/active/liquidity_baking.html) in the Octez documentation
   - Pass the `--adaptive-issuance-vote` argument; for more information, see [Adaptive Issuance and Staking](https://tezos.gitlab.io/active/adaptive_issuance.html) in the Octez documentation

   For example:

   ```bash
   octez-baker-PsQuebec run with local node "$HOME/.tezos-node" consensus_key --liquidity-baking-toggle-vote pass --adaptive-issuance-vote on --dal-node http://127.0.0.1:10732
   ```

   Note that the command for the baker depends on the protocol version.
   This example uses the Quebec protocol, so the command starts with `octez-baker-PsQuebec`.
   Check the current version of the protocol to see what command to run, and change this command when you upgrade to newer versions of the protocol.

   You may append `>>"$HOME/octez-baker.log" 2>&1` to redirect its output in a log file.

1. Ensure that the baker runs persistently.
Look up how to run programs persistently in the documentation for your operating system.
You can also refer to [Run a persistent baking node](https://opentezos.com/node-baking/baking/persistent-baker/) on opentezos.com.

   For example, if your operating system uses the `systemd` software suite, your service file might look like this example:

   ```systemd
   [Unit]
   Description=Octez baker
   Wants=network-online.target
   After=network-online.target
   Requires=octez-node.service

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   User=tezos
   ExecStart=octez-baker-PsQuebec run with local node "$HOME/.tezos-node" consensus_key --liquidity-baking-toggle-vote pass --adaptive-issuance-vote on --dal-node http://127.0.0.1:10732
   WorkingDirectory=/opt/octez-baker
   Restart=on-failure
   RestartSec=5
   StandardOutput=append:/opt/octez-baker.log
   StandardError=append:/opt/octez-baker.log
   SyslogIdentifier=%n
   ```

1. In the same terminal window, run this command:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:10732/p2p/gossipsub/topics
   ```

   DAL nodes share shards and information about them over a peer-to-peer pub/sub network built on the Gossipsub P2P protocol.
   As layer 1 assigns shards to the bakers, the Gossipsub network manages topics that DAL nodes can subscribe to.
   For example, if a user submits data to slot 1, the network has a list of topics: a topic to identify the slot 1 shards assigned to baker A, a topic to identify the slot 1 shards assigned to baker B, and so on for all the bakers that are assigned shards from slot 1.

   Then, the baker daemon automatically asks the DAL node to subscribe to the topics that provide the shards that it is assigned to.

   In the results of this command, each topic contains a shard and the address of the baker that is assigned to it.
   The DAL node and baker are listening to these topics and attesting that the data that they refer to is available.

   This command returns all of the topics that the baker is subscribed to in the format `{"slot_index":<index>,"pkh":"<ADDRESS OF BAKER>"}` where `index` varies between `0` included and the number of slot indexes excluded.

   You can also look at the baker logs to see if it injects the expected operations. At each level, the baker is expected to do a subset of these operations:

      - Receive a block proposal (log message: "received new proposal ... at level ..., round ...")
      - Inject a preattestation for it (log message: "injected preattestation ... for my_baker (&lt;address&gt;) for level ..., round ...")
      - Receive a block (log message: "received new head ... at level ..., round ...")
      - Inject a consensus attestation for it (log message: "injected attestation ... for my_baker (&lt;address&gt;) for level ..., round ...")
      - Attach a DAL attestation to it, indicating which of the shards assigned to the baker have been seen on the DAL network (log message: "ready to attach DAL attestation for level ..., round ..., with bitset ... for my_baker (&lt;address&gt;) to attest slots published at level ...")

## Upgrading the baker

The version of the baker program depends on the version of the Tezos protocol.
Therefore, when a new version of the Tezos protocol becomes active, you must start the baker for the new protocol immediately.

To simplify the upgrade process, you can follow these steps when the new protocol is about to be activated:

1. Check the release pages in the [Octez documentation](https://tezos.gitlab.io) (section `Changes in Octez releases`) or check the posts on the forum at https://forum.tezosagora.org to see which version of the Octez suite supports the upcoming protocol and upgrade your Octez suite if necessary.
The Octez release page gives instructions for upgrading.

1. Leave the baker for the previous protocol running, such as the `octez-baker-PsParisC` daemon.

1. Start the baker for the new protocol, such as the `octez-baker-PsQuebec` daemon.
This daemon is not yet able to bake because it is using the future version of the protocol, but you can run it early without causing any problems.
However, make sure not to run the baker twice **for the same protocol version and the same baker account**, to avoid being slashed for double signing.

1. When the new version of the protocol becomes active, the previous protocol baker is no longer able to bake and the new protocol baker begins to bake automatically.

1. Then you can stop the previous protocol baker.

You can upgrade accusers with a similar process.

## Calculating the delay for attestation rights

If you are setting up a new baker, you must wait until it receives attestation rights before it can bake blocks or attest to DAL data.
The delay to receive attestation rights is a number of cycles determined by the value of the `consensus_rights_delay` constant plus two cycles.

A cycle is a number of blocks; the `blocks_per_cycle` constant determines how many blocks are in a cycle.
The `minimal_block_delay` constant determines the time between blocks in seconds.
Therefore, you can calculate the approximate time in seconds that it takes a baker to receive attestation rights with this formula:

```
(consensus_rights_delay + 2) * blocks_per_cycle * minimal_block_delay
```

Follow these steps to calculate the delay to receive attestation rights:

1. Run these commands to get the values of the network constants:

   ```bash
   octez-client rpc get /chains/main/blocks/head/context/constants | jq | grep consensus_rights_delay
   ```

   ```bash
   octez-client rpc get /chains/main/blocks/head/context/constants | jq | grep blocks_per_cycle
   ```

   ```bash
   octez-client rpc get /chains/main/blocks/head/context/constants | jq | grep minimal_block_delay
   ```

   You may need to install the `jq` program to run these commands.

1. Using the values from the responses, calculate the attestation rights delay in seconds.
For example, if `consensus_rights_delay` is 2, `blocks_per_cycle` is 15,360, and `minimal_block_delay` is 4, a new baker receives attestation rights after a delay of 122,880 seconds.

1. Divide the number of seconds by 86,400 to get the attestation delay in days.
For example, if the delay is 122,880 seconds, that time is about 1.4 days.

   The exact time depends on what time in the current cycle the account staked its tez.

   :::note

   The amount of tez that the account stakes determines how often it is called on to make attestations, not how quickly it receives rights.
   Therefore, staking more tez brings more rewards but does not reduce the attestation delay.

   :::

1. After the delay computed above has passed, **the baker log** (not the Octez node log, neither the DAL node log) should contain lines that look like this:

   - Consensus pre-attestations: `injected preattestation ...`
   - Consensus attestations: `injected attestation ...`
   - Attach DAL attestations: `ready to attach DAL attestation ...`

   These lines log the attestations that the baker makes.

   If the baker does not have attestation rights, the log contains lines that start with `The following delegates have no attesting rights at level ...`.

   Note that even though the baker daemon is using the consensus key, the attestations refer to the baker key.
   The consensus key makes attestations on behalf of the baker key but the baking daemon does not need access to the baker key.

After the attestation delay, whether or not you have attestation rights, proceed to [Step 5: Verifications](/tutorials/join-dal-baker/verify-rights).

## Optional: Run an accuser

The accuser is a daemon that monitors blocks and looks for problems, such as bakers who double-sign blocks or inject multiple attestations.
If it finds a problem, it posts a denunciation operation, which leads to penalizing the misbehaving baker.
You don't have to run an accuser, but if you do, you can receive as a reward part of the penalties of the denounced baker.

Like the baker, the command for the accuser has the protocol name at the end.
For example, if your operating system uses the `systemd` software suite, the attester service file might look like this example:

```systemd
[Unit]
Description=Octez accuser
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target
Requires=octez-node.service

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=tezos
ExecStart=octez-accuser-PsQuebec run
WorkingDirectory=/opt/octez-accuser
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
StandardOutput=append:/opt/octez-accuser.log
StandardError=append:/opt/octez-accuser.log
SyslogIdentifier=%n
```
