There are many ways to create (or "mint") NFTs; in particular, you can create all of the NFTs in a collection at once or set up an application that can create NFTs as users request them.
Try one of these tutorials to see different ways of minting NFTs:

- [Create NFTs with the `tznft` tool](./create-an-nft/nft-tznft): Create metadata files to describe NFTs and then use a command-line tool to mint them and manipulate them
- [Create a web app that mints NFTs](./create-an-nft/nft-taquito): Set up a web application that authorized users can use to create NFTs and all users can use to see the NFTs in a collection
