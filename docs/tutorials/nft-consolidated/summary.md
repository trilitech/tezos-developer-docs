Now you have an application that can connect to a user's wallet, send transactions on the user's behalf, and get information from Tezos.
You also learned:

- How to use Beacon to connect to Tezos-compatible wallets
- How to use Taquito to send transactions to Tezos and get information from Tezos
- Best practices for interacting with user wallets in decentralized applications
- Creating and deploying smart contracts with SmartPy, its FA2 library, and its online IDE

If you want to continue with the application, here are some ideas:

- Customize how the contract behaves, such as requiring a fee to mint a token
- Provide more information about the tokens on the web interface
- Allow users to send tokens to other users from the web interface

If you want to expand your knowledge of Tezos and tokens, see these tutorials:
