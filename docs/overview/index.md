Tezos is an open-source, decentralized blockchain [created in 2014](https://tezos.com/whitepaper.pdf) by Arthur and Kathleen Breitman. It raised awareness and support in 2017 with its crowdfunding and launched the following year. Since its inception, Tezos has gone through multiple iterations of upgrades and development, staying true to its ethos -- "a blockchain designed to evolve".

Tezos has robust applications ranging from NFTs, DeFi, and gaming to enterprise and government use cases.

## Cutting-edge developments on Tezos

With recent Tezos upgrades heavily focusing on scaling solutions, Tezos has been at the forefront of blockchain research. Up to 1 million transactions per second (TPS) are theoretically possible on Tezos with the advent of Smart Rollups, which have emerged as a strong scaling solution. With Smart Rollups (also known as optimistic rollups), transactions can be performed more quickly and cheaply and use other VMs that “roll up” their state changes onto Tezos.

[Etherlink](https://www.etherlink.com) is another exciting technology in development that will greatly enlarge the possible applications and versatility of Tezos. Etherlink builds on Smart Rollups and combines them with [DAL (Data Availability Layer)](https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/dal-testers.html) to provide an EVM-compatible Layer 2 solution which is truly decentralized, low-latency, and low-cost.

These innovations demonstrate the ongoing dedication of Tezos to foster innovation in the blockchain industry.

## Common applications of Tezos

Here are some of the ways that people use Tezos:

### NFTs on Tezos

The rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has become a core arena of activity and growth in the blockchain space, where new communities are growing around artists, musicians, and other creators with the use of blockchain tokens. NFTs allow collectors and fans to hold a piece of content produced by a creator, providing proof of ownership and secure exchanges on the blockchain.

[Objkt](https://objkt.com/), [FxHash](https://www.fxhash.xyz/), [Teia](https://teia.art/), [DNS.xyz](https://dns.xyz/) are some of the marketplaces for Tezos art and music NFTs. They allow creators to mint and sell their work in addition to providing a platform for users to collect such works.

Tezos is also being used for other NFT-related projects, such as [MoneyTrack](https://moneytrack.io/), which is a payment platform that uses NFTs to control directed payment flows.

### Enterprise and Government Uses of Tezos

Enterprises and regulatory bodies have been adopting Tezos as well.

Tezos is being used by the French Armies and Gendarmerie's Information Center to [validate judicial expenses](https://cointelegraph.com/news/french-cybercrime-division-uses-smart-contacts-on-tezos-blockchain) incurred during investigations and record them on Tezos.

In recent years, the concept of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) has gained traction, with several countries around the world exploring their own CBDC projects. Société Générale carried out a series of successful tests [using Tezos](https://decrypt.co/112127/societe-generales-crypto-division-lands-regulatory-approval-france) to explore the potential of CBDCs. In September 2020, the bank announced that it had completed a pilot program using a custom-built version of the Tezos blockchain to simulate the issuance and circulation of CBDCs. The pilot involved testing the technology's ability to handle transactions, make payments, and settle transactions in a digital environment.

The California DMV is also using Tezos for its project to [put car titles on the blockchain](https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/01/26/california-announces-dmv-run-blockchain-through-partnership-with-tezos/).

[Sword Group](https://www.sword-group.com/2020/09/28/sword-launches-tezos-digisign/) an international technology company, launched DigiSign, an open-source tool built on Tezos that enables users to digitally sign, certify, and verify the authenticity of digital documents.

### Tezos in Gaming

Recently, the [Tezos Unity SDK](https://tezos.com/unity/) promises to make blockchain game development easier and faster. It allows for the addition of web3 features such as allowing players to link their accounts across games, mint, and trade in-game items and currencies, and show off their ranks and accomplishments on public, on-chain leaderboards.
