SmartPy is a comprehensive solution for developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain. With its easy-to-use Python syntax, developers can create contracts in a familiar and intuitive way, while SmartPy's type inference provides added safety.

Before deployment, contracts can be tested in simulated scenarios, including complex cases with multiple interacting contracts. Once ready, SmartPy contracts are compiled to [Michelson](https://tezos.gitlab.io/michelson-reference/), the Tezos blockchain's native language, for deployment.

The [SmartPy online IDE](https://smartpy.io/ide) offers a user-friendly interface for trying out the system directly in a web browser. It comes with an origination feature for deployment of contracts to the blockchain at the click of a button. For those who prefer to write smart contracts and tests in their favourite editor, SmartPy also offers a [command-line interface](./smartpy/introduction/installation).

There is also the [SmartPy explorer](https://smartpy.io/explorer), which allows easy exploration and interaction with already deployed contracts. It presents contract data as SmartPy values, such as records and variants.

With SmartPy, the possibilities for creating and deploying smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain are endless!
