One of the main features of blockchains is _decentralization_: each transaction is verified by multiple nodes and its validation process does not rely on a single trusted third party.
Decentralized applications (dApps or Dapps) take advantage of these features to create applications that are independent, transparent, and trustless.

In general, dApps have these parts:

- **Frontend**: An off-chain component that can act as a user interface to simplify interaction with the on-chain component, run off-chain processing, and get information from sources that are not available to the on-chain component
- **Middleware**: Optionally, an [indexer](./developing/information/indexers) to interpret the backend information and provide it in a more convenient format for the front-end component
- **Backend**: An on-chain component that consists of one or more [smart contracts](./smart-contracts)

The off-chain component can be nearly any kind of program, including a web application, mobile or desktop app, or command-line interface.
It relies on wallets and tools to interact with the smart contract on behalf of a user's Tezos account.

Some of these tools that allow an off-chain component to interact with smart contracts include:

- [Taquito](./dApps/taquito), an SDK for JavaScript/TypeScript applications
- The [Tezos SDK for Unity](./unity), a toolkit for Unity applications
- [Taqueria](https://taqueria.io/), a development platform for dApps

## Sample dApps

For example dApps, see [Sample dApps](./dApps/samples).

## Best practices

Good programming and design practices make dApps easier to use and provide a better user experience.
See [Best practices and avoiding flaws](./dApps/best-practices).

## dApp tasks

For information on typical tasks that dApps do, see:

- [Connecting to wallets](./dApps/wallets)
- [Sending transactions](./dApps/sending-transactions)

## Tutorials

These tutorials cover dApps of different complexities:

- For a simple dApp, see [Build a simple web application](./tutorials/build-your-first-app)
- For a dApp that mints NFTs, see [Mint NFTs from a web app](./tutorials/create-an-nft/nft-web-app)
- For a large dApp that allows users to buy and sell NFTs, see [Build an NFT marketplace](./tutorials/build-an-nft-marketplace)
