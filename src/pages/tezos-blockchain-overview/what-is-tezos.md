# What is Tezos?

Tezos is a self-amending blockchain that aims to provide a more secure, efficient, and sustainable platform for decentralized applications. Tezos is built on a liquid proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which requires users to stake their tokens through a validator (called a baker) in order to participate in the network's governance. This allows Tezos to achieve greater energy efficiency and scalability than proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Tezos is also designed to be upgradeable without the need for a hard fork. This means that the protocol can be updated over time to address security vulnerabilities or implement new features without disrupting the network.

Tezos has a number of advantages over other blockchain platforms, including:

* **Self-amendment:** Tezos is the only blockchain that can upgrade itself without the need for a hard fork. This makes it more secure and adaptable to change.
* **Liquid proof-of-stake:** Tezos uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is more energy efficient and scalable than proof-of-work. It is called *liquid* because the users don't lose ownership of their tokens when delegating them.
* **Formal verification:** Tezos is designed to be secure through formal verification, a mathematical technique that proves the correctness of the code of smart contracts.
* **Active community:** Tezos has a large and active community of developers and users.

Tezos is a blockchain platform with the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the internet. It is a secure, efficient, and sustainable platform for decentralized applications.

Here are some of the key features of Tezos:

* **Smart contracts:** Tezos can be used to deploy smart contracts written in Michelson, which are programs that live on the blockchain and can be used to automate a variety of tasks.
* **Decentralized applications (dApps):** Tezos can be used to build decentralized applications (dApps), which are applications that use the blockchain as a backend.
* **Governance:** Tezos is a self-governing blockchain, which means that the community can vote on changes to the protocol.
* **Scalability:** Tezos is designed to be scalable through its upgrade mechanism to handle more transactions and more usage.

Tezos is a blockchain platform that has the potential to become a major player in the blockchain industry. It is a secure, efficient, and sustainable platform for decentralized applications.
