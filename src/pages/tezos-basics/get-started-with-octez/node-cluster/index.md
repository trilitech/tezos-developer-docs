**(Thank you to [Oxhead Alpha](https://www.oxheadalpha.com/) for coding this great tool)**

Deploying a Tezos node is a good way to address certain needs when working with the Tezos blockchain. It can be used to broadcast operations or to query specific information such as the latest block of the chain or the storage of a particular smart contract. 

But when working with decentralized applications (dApps), the node can become a bottleneck.

The more people interact with a decentralized application, the more queries the node has to handle, and **a single node is not suited to answer hundreds or thousands of requests per second**.

In those situations, it becomes necessary to set up an infrastructure that can handle the load – by deploying a **cluster of nodes**.

This tutorial, inspired by [Oxhead Alpha's medium article](https://medium.com/the-aleph/deploy-scalable-tezos-nodes-in-the-cloud-bbe4f4f4ddcc), aims to be a practical guide to deploying your own cluster of Tezos nodes using AWS cloud’s managed Kubernetes offering (EKS). For further technical explanations, we refer you to the above-mentioned article. 

For our setup, we will be using [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/), an amazingly flexible infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool. At the end of the tutorial, we will expose the nodes’ RPC endpoint to the internet via a load balancing system. 

The resulting infrastructure is highly available, scalable, customizable, and supports rolling upgrades (a must-have, given Tezos' amendment pace). The tool enables us to scale the number of Tezos nodes as desired (0 to n).

# Prerequisites

- [AWS account and CLI tool](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/?nc1=h_ls)
- [Pulumi account and CLI tool](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [k9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s)
- [Lens](https://k8slens.dev/) (used for the monitoring)

Follow [the Pulumi tutorial](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/aws/begin/) to create an AWS account if you don’t already have one, and install Pulumi. *Your AWS IAM user must have the ability to create a VPC and EKS cluster*.

# 1 Create a Pulumi project 

Create a Pulumi project using the following lines:

```bash
mkdir tezos-aws && cd tezos-aws
pulumi new aws-typescript
```

:::info
You may have to execute the following command, before executing any Pulumi interaction:
```sh
export PATH="$PATH:~/.pulumi/bin"
```
:::

# 2 Tezos Pulumi installation

Install the tezos-pulumi node module:

```bash
npm install @oxheadalpha/tezos-pulumi --save-exact
```

Below are the most important files, which we need to take a careful look at:

- **values.yaml**: file that specifies what we’d like the tezos-k8s Helm chart to deploy inside k8s. You may see [here](https://github.com/oxheadalpha/tezos-k8s/blob/master/charts/tezos/values.yaml) for the full tezos-k8s values spec but what we provide here is sufficient for the tutorial.

- **index.ts**: Typescript file which will deploy the Tezos infrastructure. It is very customizable as we can easily write IaC (infrastructure as code) in languages like Typescript.

## 2.1 Populate the *value.yaml* file

Create a values.yaml file with the code provided below:

```yml
# Define the types of Tezos nodes we want to deploy in our cluster
nodes:
  rolling-node:
    storage_size: 100Gi
    # We create a new k8s storage class in the Pulumi index.ts file that allows
    # us to expand an EBS volume's size. The default gp2 storage class created
    # by EKS does not allow for volume expansion. We tell our `rolling-nodes` to
    # use this storage class.
    storageClassName: "gp2-volume-expansion"
    # Run the Octez implementation of Tezos node, as opposed to Tezedge's
    # implementation.
    runs:
      - octez_node
    # Create 2 Tezos rolling nodes that will be distributed across the 2 cluster
    # EC2 nodes we will be deploying.
    instances:
      - config:
          shell:
            history_mode: rolling
      - config:
          shell:
            history_mode: rolling

# Have the nodes download and use a tarball of a mainnet rolling node
# filesystem. This allows the nodes to sync much faster with the head of the
# chain than if they started from the genesis block.
rolling_tarball_url: https://mainnet.xtz-shots.io/rolling-tarball
# The default tezos-k9s Helm chart values.yaml uses this field by default. So we
# set it to null here to disable it and use the tarball url instead. Syncing a
# node from a tarball is much faster than a Tezos snapshot.
rolling_snapshot_url: null
```

## 2.2 Populate the *index.ts* file

Paste the following code in the index.ts file generated by Pulumi, overwriting the Pulumi generated code. Read the comments to get an understanding of what is happening:

```ts
import * as awsx from "@pulumi/awsx"
import * as eks from "@pulumi/eks"

const vpc = new awsx.ec2.Vpc(

# 3 Deployment

Now it's time to deploy our Tezos infrastructure!

Run the following command to launch your cluster:

```bash
pulumi up 
```

:::caution
You may probably have to execute the following command, before launching the cluster. Chose your prefered AWS region (`us-east-2`	
 for Ohio, `eu-central-1` for Frankfurt, etc.):
```sh
pulumi config set region
```
:::
Pulumi will display a url that you can visit to view the status of your deployment on the Pulumi web console.

# 4 Monitoring 

In order to monitor the cluster liveness, we have chosen [Lens](https://k8slens.dev/) (An IDE for Kubernetes) as a monitoring tool.

Execute the following command to provide the kubeconfig file to Lens: 

```sh
pulumi stack output kubeconfig --show-secrets --json > kubeconfig.json
```

Now, you can graphically monitor your cluster liveness (in our case, our 3 rolling nodes):

<p align="center">

![lens](developers/docs/images/node-cluster/lens.png)
<small className="figure">Lens monitoring</small>
</p>

Note that by clicking on the load balancer, you will find its url. Let’s curl it in a terminal to get the Mainnet chain id:

```sh
curl http://<ADDRESS>/chains/main/chain_id
"NetXdQprcVkpaWU"
```

:::info 
The `<ADDRESS>` RPC endpoint is a URL generated by AWS. It is possible to deploy the RPC behind a specific domain name. This would require buying or importing a domain and configuring it with [Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/). 
:::

:::info
[k9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s) can also be used, instead of Lens, to monitor your cluster via CLI.
As above, the following lines allow to provide the config and launch k9s:
```
# Get the cluster's kubeconfig and save it to a file

pulumi stack output kubeconfig --show-secrets --json > kubeconfig.json

# Set the KUBECONFIG environment variable to point k9s to our kubeconfig.

export KUBECONFIG=./kubeconfig.json

# Let's get into our cluster!

k9s
```
:::

Congratulations! Now you have your own cluster of Tezos nodes, running on AWS cloud, and exposed to the internet! 🎉
