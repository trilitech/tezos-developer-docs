## Wallets

Now, let's talk about the wallet.

The wallet is a key element of your dapp, without it, the users won't be able to interact with the Tezos blockchain, which defeats your purpose. There are multiple considerations to take into account when you are setting up the wallet that we will explain below.

First, you want to isolate the wallet and its different interactions and values in the same component, called `Wallet.svelte` in our example. When using the Beacon SDK, it is crucial to keep a **single instance of Beacon** running in order to prevent bugs.

When the Wallet component mounts, there are different things you want to do:

```typescript=
onMount(async () => {
    const wallet = new BeaconWallet({
      name: "Tezos dev portal dapp tutorial",
      preferredNetwork: network
    });
    store.updateWallet(wallet);
    const activeAccount = await wallet.client.getActiveAccount();
    if (activeAccount) {
      const userAddress = (await wallet.getPKH()) as TezosAccountAddress;
      store.updateUserAddress(userAddress);
      $store.Tezos.setWalletProvider(wallet);
      await getWalletInfo(wallet);
      // fetches user's XTZ, tzBTC and SIRS balances
      const res = await fetchBalances($store.Tezos, userAddress);
      if (res) {
        store.updateUserBalance("XTZ", res.xtzBalance);
        store.updateUserBalance("tzBTC", res.tzbtcBalance);
        store.updateUserBalance("SIRS", res.sirsBalance);
      } else {
        store.updateUserBalance("XTZ", null);
        store.updateUserBalance("tzBTC", null);
        store.updateUserBalance("SIRS", null);
      }
    }
  });
```

You create the instance of the `BeaconWallet` by providing a name for the dapp (it can be whatever you want) that will be displayed in the wallet UI and the network you want to connect to (imported from the config file). The instance of the wallet is then saved in the store.

Now, you want to check if the user connected a wallet before. Beacon will keep track of live connections in the local storage, this is how your users can navigate to your dapp and have their wallet connected automagically!

The `BeaconWallet` instance provides a `client` property with different methods, the one you need here is `getActiveAccount()`, which will retrieve any live connection stored in the local storage.
If there is a live connection, you can fetch the user's address and save it into the store, update the store with the user's address before setting up the wallet as the signer with `$store.Tezos.setWalletProvider(wallet)`, get the information you need about the wallet (mainly, the name of the wallet) with the `getWalletInfo()` function and then, fetch the balances for the address that is connected with the `fetchBalances()` function described earlier.
Once the balances are fetched, they are saved into the store to be displayed in the interface.

> \*Note: `TezosAccountAddress` is a custom type I like to use to validate Tezos addresses for implicit accounts:
> `type TezosAccountAddress = tz${"1" | "2" | "3"}${string}`
> TypeScript will raise a warning if you try to use a string that doesn't match this pattern.

### Connecting the wallet

Taquito and Beacon working in unison make it very easy to connect the wallet. A few lines of code using the APIs of these two essential libraries on Tezos are going to make miracles.

Here is how to do it:

```typescript=
const connectWallet = async () => {
    if (!$store.wallet) {
      const wallet = new BeaconWallet({
        name: "Tezos dev portal dapp tutorial",
        preferredNetwork: network
      });
      store.updateWallet(wallet);
    }

    await $store.wallet.requestPermissions({
      network: { type: network, rpcUrl }
    });
    const userAddress = (await $store.wallet.getPKH()) as TezosAccountAddress;
    store.updateUserAddress(userAddress);
    $store.Tezos.setWalletProvider($store.wallet);
    // finds account info
    await getWalletInfo($store.wallet);
    // fetches user's XTZ, tzBTC and SIRS balances
    const res = await fetchBalances($store.Tezos, userAddress);
    if (res) {
      store.updateUserBalance("XTZ", res.xtzBalance);
      store.updateUserBalance("tzBTC", res.tzbtcBalance);
      store.updateUserBalance("SIRS", res.sirsBalance);
    } else {
      store.updateUserBalance("XTZ", null);
      store.updateUserBalance("tzBTC", null);
      store.updateUserBalance("SIRS", null);
    }
  };
```

The connection will be handled in a specific function called `connectWallet`.
If the store doesn't hold an instance of the `BeaconWallet` (if the dapp didn't detect any live connection on mount), you create that instance and save it in the store.

Next, you ask the user to select a wallet with the `requestPermissions()` method present on the instance of the `BeaconWallet`. The parameter is an object where you indicate the network you want to connect to as well as the URL of the Tezos RPC node you will interact with.

After the user selects a wallet to use with our dapp, you get their address with the `getPKH()` method on the `BeaconWallet` instance, you update the signer in the `TezosToolkit` instance by passing the wallet instance to `setWalletProvider()`, you get the information you need from the wallet and you fetch the user's balances.

Now, the wallet is connected and the user is shown their different balances, as well as a connection status in the sidebar!

> IMPORTANT: however you want to design your dapp, it is essential to keep one single instance of the `BeaconWallet` and it is highly recommended to do the same with the instance of the `TezosToolkit`. Creating multiple instances messes with the state of your app and with Taquito in general.

### Disconnecting the wallet

Disconnecting the wallet is as important as connecting it. There is nothing more frustrating than looking for how to disconnect your wallet for hours when it is not made explicit. Remember, a lot of users have multiple wallets (like Temple or Kukai) and even multiple addresses within the same wallet that they want to use to interact with your dapp. Make disconnecting the wallet easy for them.

```typescript=
const disconnectWallet = async () => {
    $store.wallet.client.clearActiveAccount();
    store.updateWallet(undefined);
    store.updateUserAddress(undefined);
    connectedNetwork = "";
    walletIcon = "";
  };
```

There are different steps to disconnect the wallet and reset the state of the dapp:

- `$store.wallet.client.clearActiveAccount()` -> kills the current connection to Beacon
- `store.updateWallet(undefined)` -> removes the wallet from the state in order to trigger a reload of the interface
- `store.updateUserAddress(undefined)` -> removes the current user's address from the state to update the UI
- `connectedNetwork = ""; walletIcon = ""` -> also needed to reset the state of the dapp and present an interface where no wallet is connected

The call to `clearActiveAccount()` on the wallet instance is the only thing that you will do in whatever dapp you are building, it will remove all the data in the local storage and when your user revisits your dapp, they won't be automatically connected with their wallet.

### Design considerations

Writing code to interact with a wallet in a decentralized application is a very new paradigm and although you will be able to reuse a lot of concepts and good practices from your experience as a developer, there are also a few new things to keep in mind:

1. Never prompt the users to connect their wallet after the dapp is mounted: getting a wallet pop-up on your screen just after the app is loaded is annoying, you have to remember that a lot of your users are non-technical and don't understand that connecting a wallet is harmless, so they may be wary about your dapp if you ask them to connect their wallet from the get-go. Instead, present some information about your dapp and a button to manually connect their wallet, if this is their first time.
2. The button to connect a wallet must stand out in your interface, whether you make it bigger, with a different color, or a different font, the users must not spend more than a couple of seconds to find it.
3. The button must be in a predictable position: most dapps on Tezos place their button to connect a wallet at the top-left or top-right of the UI. You are not _"creative"_ by placing the button in some other location, you will just end up confusing your users.
4. The text in the button should read **Connect** or something similar, avoid **Sync** or other words but "connect" as they can mean something different in the context of a decentralized application.
5. The status of the wallet must be displayed in the dapp. Whether it is connected or disconnected, the user should be able to tell. Additionally, you can add some information about the wallet they are using (like you do in this tutorial), the network they are connected to, or their balance.
6. You must enable/disable the interactions of your dapp that depend on the wallet. Users shouldn't be able to interact with a feature of your application that requires their wallet to be connected if this is not the case.


One of the most important features of the dapp which is also among the easiest ones to overlook is fetching the user's balances. Users can tell something is wrong if their balances don't show properly or don't update accordingly after an interaction with the contract, that's why it's crucial to take care of displaying and updating their balances.

Because we are going to fetch balances in different components of our application, we will create a function in the `utils.ts` file and import it when necessary.

In order to fetch the balances, we will use Taquito for the XTZ balance of the user and a very popular API on Tezos for tzBTC and SIRS balances, the [TzKT API](https://api.tzkt.io/). If you want to build more complex applications on Tezos, a good knowledge of the TzKT API is essential as it provides a lot of features that will make your apps richer in content and faster.

Let's have a look at the function type:

```typescript=
export const fetchBalances = async (
  Tezos: TezosToolkit,
  userAddress: TezosAccountAddress
): Promise<{
  xtzBalance: number;
  tzbtcBalance: number;
  sirsBalance: number;
} | null> => {
	try {
	// the code will be here
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return null;
  }
}
```

The `fetchBalances` function will take 2 parameters: an instance of the `TezosToolkit` to fetch the user's XTZ balance and the user's address to retrieve the balances that match the address. It will return an object with 3 properties: `xtzBalance`, `tzbtcBalance`, and `sirsBalance` or `null` if any error occurs.

First, let's fetch the XTZ balance:

```typescript=
const xtzBalance = await Tezos.tz.getBalance(userAddress);
if (!xtzBalance) throw "Unable to fetch XTZ balance";
```

The instance of the `TezosToolkit` includes a property called `tz` that allows different Tezos-specific actions, one of them is about fetching the balance of an account by its address through the `getBalance()` method that takes the address of the account as a parameter.

Next, we check for the existence of a balance and we reject the promise if it doesn't exist. If it does, the balance will be available as a [BigNumber](https://mikemcl.github.io/bignumber.js/).

>*Note: as it is the case most of the time, Taquito returns numeric values from the blockchain as BigNumber, because some values could be very big numbers and JavaScript is notorious for being bad at handling large numbers*

Once the XTZ balance has been fetched, we can continue and fetch the balances of tzBTC and SIRS:

```typescript=
import { tzbtcAddress, sirsAddress } from "./config";

// previous code for the function

const res = await fetch(
      `https://api.tzkt.io/v1/tokens/balances?account=${userAddress}&token.contract.in=${tzbtcAddress},${sirsAddress}`
    );
    if (res.status === 200) {
      const data = await res.json();
      if (Array.isArray(data) && data.length === 2) {
        const tzbtcBalance = +data[0].balance;
        const sirsBalance = +data[1].balance;
        if (!isNaN(tzbtcBalance) && !isNaN(sirsBalance)) {
          return {
            xtzBalance: xtzBalance.toNumber(),
            tzbtcBalance,
            sirsBalance
          };
        } else {
          return null;
        }
      }
    } else {
      throw "Unable to fetch tzBTC and SIRS balances";
    }
```

You can check [this link](https://api.tzkt.io/#operation/Tokens_GetTokenBalances) to get more details about how to fetch token balances with the TzKT API. It's a simple `fetch` with a URL that is built dynamically to include the user's address and the addresses of the contracts for tzBTC and SIRS.

When the promise resolves with a `200` code, this means that the data has been received. We parse it into JSON with the `.json()` method on the response and we check that the data has the expected shape, i.e. an array with 2 elements in it.

The first element is the tzBTC balance and the second one is the SIRS balance. We store them in their own variables that we cast to numbers before verifying that they were cast properly with `isNaN`. If everything goes well, the 3 balances are returned and if anything goes wrong along the way, the function returns `null`.

After fetching the balances in any component of our application, we store this data in the store to update the state:

```typescript=
const res = await fetchBalances($store.Tezos, userAddress);
if (res) {
  store.updateUserBalance("XTZ", res.xtzBalance);
  store.updateUserBalance("tzBTC", res.tzbtcBalance);
  store.updateUserBalance("SIRS", res.sirsBalance);
} else {
  store.updateUserBalance("XTZ", null);
  store.updateUserBalance("tzBTC", null);
  store.updateUserBalance("SIRS", null);
}
```

And that's it, you fetched the user's balances in XTZ, tzBTC, and SIRS!
