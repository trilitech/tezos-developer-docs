# The Coq language
As mentioned on the [Inria website](http://coq.inria.fr), **Coq** is a formal proof management system. It provides a formal language to write mathematical definitions, executable algorithms and theorems together with an environment for semi-interactive development of machine-checked proofs. Typical applications include the certification of properties of programming languages (e.g. the CompCert compiler certification project, the Verified Software Toolchain for verification of C programs, or the Iris framework for concurrent separation logic), the formalization of mathematics (e.g. the full formalization of the Feit-Thompson theorem, or homotopy type theory), and teaching. 

*For more information, please read the [Coq documentation](https://coq.inria.fr/documentation).*

## Some syntactical elements of the Coq language

### Coq language

* Boolean type definition:

```coq
 Inductive  bool : Type :=
     | true
     | false.
```

* Definition of a function that returns the denial of a Boolean:

```coq
Definition negb (b:bool) : bool :=
     match b with
     | true => false
     | false => true
     end.
```

### A few syntactical elements of the Coq language

Here is an example of proof that may be implemented:

```coq
test_orb1: (orb true false) = true.
```

```coq
Proof.
simpl. (* ===> true = true *)
reflexivity. (* ===> no more subgoals *)
Qed.
```

The example above shows that true or false equals true. The first line matches the one that we want to demonstrate. The lines between the Proof and Qed keywords form the proof.
All words between Proof and Qed[^2] are called tactics. These are functions that allow us to make our demonstration step by step.
All tactics are referenced in the list of [Coq tactics](https://coq.inria.fr/refman/proof-engine/tactics.html#coq%3Atacv.destruct-eqn).

{% callout type="note" title="Note 1" %}
     Please note that for some typing reasons, `orb`, `andb` and `negb` do respectively refer to the functions `or`, `and` and `neg` defined on booleans.
{% /callout %}
{% callout type="note" title="Note 2" %}
     QED = quod erat demonstrandum; what was to be shown (in Latin).
{% /callout %}

## Proof creation using Mi-Cho-Coq
As **Coq** is a proof software that has its own syntax, the difficulty has been in finding a way to translate the **Michelson** code into **Coq**. 

[Mi-Cho-Coq](https://gitlab.com/nomadic-labs/mi-cho-coq) is the library that allows you to do this. When you wish to prove a smart contract written or compiled down in Michelson, you must use this library and import the code that you wish to formally prove. The syntax to be used at the start of the file containing the proof is as follows:

```coq
Require Import Michocoq.macros. Import syntax.
Require Import Michocoq.semantics. Require Import Michocoq.util.
Import error.
```

## Execution of a simple proof using Coq software

We can execute the proof of 'Example test_orb2" (Example keyword below) using the Coq proof assistant.

{% figure src="/images/coq/proof_1.jpeg" alt="coq-proof-execution-1" caption="Proof of execution with the Coq software, proving that `false or false => false`. 1/3" %}  {% /figure %}

{% figure src="/images/coq/proof_2.jpeg" alt="coq-proof-execution-2" caption="Proof of execution with the Coq software, simplification step using the definition of `orb`. 2/3" %} {% /figure %}

{% figure src="/images/coq/proof_3.jpeg" alt="coq-proof-execution-3" caption="Proof of execution with the Coq software, reflexivity step compares both terms to end the proof. 3/3" %} {% /figure %}

End of proof.
