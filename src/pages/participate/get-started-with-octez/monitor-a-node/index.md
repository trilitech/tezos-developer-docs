This section will guide you through the steps to set up a monitoring tool that will allow you to track various metrics of an Octez node.

Until now, the only tool developers had to monitor the behavior of their Tezos node was to look at the logs, [adjust the log verbosity](https://tezos.gitlab.io/user/logging.html?highlight=log#node-specific-configuration), and reconstruct all relevant information from this stream. But getting more insight into a node's performance was tedious and difficult. For instance, the number of connected peers, the number of pending operations, or the number of times the validator switched branches, were not easy to observe continuously.

After a few iterations of different methods to gather node information and statistics that could be easily analyzed, we have recently chosen to include metrics within the node. With Octez Metrics it's simple to get a myriad of statistics about your node -- and quite efficiently so. You can also attach a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboard to get a visual representation of how your node is performing. And with [Grafazos](https://gitlab.com/nomadic-labs/grafazos), you can get customized ready-to-use dashboards for monitoring your Tezos node.

What metrics can we monitor ?

There are two types of metrics on an Octez node that can be monitored:

- hardware metrics
- node metrics

[Here](https://tezos.gitlab.io/developer/openmetrics.html) is an exhaustive list of Octez node metrics. Hardware metrics depend on your machine characteristics, but we will focus on performance metrics like the CPU usage, RAM, memory, etc.

## Overview of monitoring tools

### [Netdata](https://www.netdata.cloud/)

Netdata is a light and open-source software that collects and exposes hardware metrics of a physical machine, and is capable of collecting fresh data every second. Netdata is a complete tool that provides various graphics visualization (histogram, tables, gauge, points), alerting + triggering tools, and many other features.

### [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)

Grafana is software that takes JSON in input and makes dashboards that you can display using your browser (the high-level web interface that displays all the metrics). In our case, JSONs are provided by Grafazos.

### [Grafazos](https://gitlab.com/nomadic-labs/grafazos) 
Grafazos is a jsonnet library written by Nomadic Labs, which uses itself [grafonet-lib](https://github.com/grafana/grafonnet-lib), which is a jsonnet library to write Grafana dashboards as code.

### [jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/)

Jsonnet is a programming language that allows to create JSONs easily.

### [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/#what-is-prometheus) 

Prometheus server is a toolkit that scrapes and stores time series data by making requests to the nodes. Basically, prometheus is fed by both netdata and tezos-metrics (which is deprecated and not used), and then, grafana displays the data gathered by prometheus.


## Light monitoring of an Octez node with Netdata

### Set up the monitoring

#### Step 1: Install Netdata on your node host

We recommend to look at [Install on Linux with one-line installer](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/get-started#install-on-linux-with-one-line-installer) to make a personalised installation. Else, copy the following command:

```bash
wget -O /tmp/netdata-kickstart.sh https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh && sh /tmp/netdata-kickstart.sh
```

#### Step 2: Add the collector plugin for Octez metrics

This plugin scrapes the metrics of your octez node to display the metrics with Netdata. You have the choice between bash, python or go plugins. The best performing plugin is the plugin coded in go. However, if you want to modify a plugin to your liking, choose the language that suits you best. The plugin must be placed in a specific directory as described below:

**Bash plugin:**

Create a file named `tezosMetrics.chart.sh` in `/usr/libexec/netdata/charts.d` and paste the following bash code into the file.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

url=http://127.0.0.1:9091/metrics #Octez metrics' are avaible on port 9091 by default. You can changer the url variable if you haven't the same port.
tezosMetrics_update_every=1
tezosMetrics_priority=1
lastTimestamp=


tezosMetrics_get() {
response=$(curl $url 2>/dev/null)
#With this following command you get all metrics of your node except octez_version{...}
eval "$(echo "$response" | grep -v \# | grep -v octez_version | sed -e 's/[.].*$//g' | sed -e 's/", /_/g'| sed -e 's/{/_/g' | sed -e 's/="/_/g' |  sed -e 's/"}//g'| sed -e 's/ /=/g'| sed -e 's/<//g'| sed -e 's/>//g'| sed -e 's/\//_/g')"
#this command allows to catch "octez_version" metric
eval "$(echo "$response" | grep -v \# | grep octez_version | sed -e 's/, / \n/g' | sed -e 's/{/\n/g'| sed -e 's/}//g' | sed -e 's/ 0.*//g' |tail -n 6 |sed -e 's/^/octez_/')"
return 0
}



#The following function is called once at netdata startup to check the availability of metrics
tezosMetrics_check() {
 status=$(curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}\n" $url)
 [ $status -eq 200 ] || return 1
 return 0
}



#The following function is called once at netdata startup to create the charts
tezosMetrics_create() {
response=$(curl $url 2>/dev/null)
metrics=$(echo "$response" | grep -v \# | grep -v octez_version | sed -e 's/", /_/g'| sed -e 's/{/_/g' | sed -e 's/="/_/g' |  sed -e 's/"}//g'| sed -e 's/[ ].*$//g'| sed -e 's/<//g'| sed -e 's/>//g'| sed -e 's/\//_/g')
#CHART type.id name title units family context charttype priority update_every options plugin module
#DIMENSION id name algorithm multiplier divisor options
#More details here: https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/collectors/plugins.d
for metric in $metrics #this loop creates the charts and the dimensions of all metrics except octez_version metric (because of its format is a bit different)
do
cat << EOF
CHART tezosMetrics.$metric '' "$metric" "" tezosMetricsFamily tezosMetricsContext line $((tezosMetrics_priority)) $tezosMetrics_update_every '' '' 'tezosMetrics'
DIMENSION $metric absolute 1 1
EOF
done
#The code below creates the chart for octez_version
eval "$(echo "$response" | grep -v \# | grep octez_version | sed -e 's/, / \n/g' | sed -e 's/{/\n/g'| sed -e 's/}//g' | sed -e 's/ 0.*//g' |tail -n 6 |sed -e 's/^/octez_/')"
cat << EOF
CHART tezosMetrics.octez_version '' 'node_version: $octez_version | octez_chain_name: $octez_chain_name | octez_distributed_db_version: $octez_distributed_db_version | octez_p2p_version: $octez_p2p_version | octez_commit_hash: $octez_commit_hash | octez_commit_date: $octez_commit_date' '' tezosMetricsFamily tezosMetricsContext line $((tezosMetrics_priority)) $tezosMetrics_update_every '' '' 'tezosMetrics'
DIMENSION 'octez_version' 'node_version: $octez_version | octez_chain_name: $octez_chain_name | octez_distributed_db_version: $octez_distributed_db_version | octez_p2p_version: $octez_p2p_version | octez_commit_hash: $octez_commit_hash | octez_commit_date: $octez_commit_date' absolute 1 1
EOF
return 0
}



#The following function update the values of the charts
tezosMetrics_update() {
tezosMetrics_get || return 1
for metric in $metrics
do
cat << VALUESOF
BEGIN tezosMetrics.$metric $1
SET $metric = $[$metric]
END
VALUESOF
done
#The code below updates the octez_version metric chart
cat << EOF
BEGIN tezosMetrics.octez_version $1
SET octez_version = 0
END
EOF

return 0
}
```

#### Step 3: Open the metrics port of your node

When starting your node, add the  `--metrics-addr=:9091` option to open a port for the Octez metrics. (By default the port is 9091, but you can arbitrarily choose any other one, at your convenience. Just make sure to change the port in the plugin code accordingly.).

Here is an example, when launching your Tezos node:

```bash
octez-node run --rpc-addr 127.0.0.1:8732 --log-output tezos.log --metrics-addr=:9091
```

#### Step 4: Restart the Netdata server

Once you've gotten the plugin on your machine, restart the Netdata server using:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart netdata
```

#### Step 5: Open the dashboard

You have in fact two ways to [open your dashboard](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/dashboard/how-dashboard-works#open-the-dashboard):

- You can access Netdata's dashboard by navigating to <http://NODE:19999> in your browser (replace NODE by either localhost or the hostname/IP address of a remote node)

- You can also use [Netdata Cloud](https://app.netdata.cloud/) to create custom dashboards, monitor several nodes, and invite users to watch your dashboard... It's free of charges and your data are never stored in a remote cloud server, but rather in the local disk of your machines.

We recommend to use Netdata Cloud for a more user-friendly usage. The rest of this tutorial is based on Netdata Cloud.

#### Step 6: Create a custom dashboard with Netdata Cloud!

Netdata provides a really intuitive tool to create custom dashboards. If you wants more details, read [Netdata documentation](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/cloud/visualize/dashboards).

[Here](https://tezos.gitlab.io/developer/openmetrics.html) is an exhaustive list of Octez node metrics. With Netdata, your node metrics will have this format: "tezosMetrics.name_of_your_metric".

For instance you can monitor the following relevant metrics:
- `octez_version` to get the chain name, version of your node, the Octez commit date,  etc.
- `octez_validator_chain_is_bootsrtapped` to see if your node is bootstrapped (it returns 1 if the node is bootstrapped, 0 otherwise).
- `octez_p2p_connections_outgoing` which represents the number of outgoing connections.
- `octez_validator_chain_last_finished_request_completion_timestamp` which is the timestamp at which the latest request handled by the worker was completed.
- `octez_p2p_peers_accepted` is the number of accepted connections.
- `octez_p2p_connections_active` is the number of active connections.
- `octez_store_invalid_blocks` is the number of blocks known to be invalid stored on the disk.
- `octez_validator_chain_head_round` is the round (in the consensus protocol) of the current node’s head.
- `ocaml_gc_allocated_bytes` is the total number of bytes allocated since the program was started.
- `octez_mempool_pending_applied` is the number of pending operations in the mempool, waiting to be applied.

You can also monitor relevant hardware data (metrics names may differ depending on your hardware configuration):

- `disk_space._` to get the remaining free space on your disks.
- `cpu.cpu_freq` to get the frequency of each core of your machine.
- `system.ram` to get the remaining free RAM and it's overall usage.

Plenty of others metrics  are available, depending on your machine and needs.

This is an example of a Demo Dashboard with the following metrics:
- `octez_version` 
- `octez_validator_chain_is_bootstrapped`
- `Disk Space Usage`
- `CPU Usage`
- `RAM Usage`
- `octez_p2p_connections_active`
- `octez_p2p_peers_running`
- `octez_store_last_written_block_size`

![Example of a light monitoring dashboard](/developers/docs/images/monitor-a-node/netdata_dashboard.png)

### Monitoring several nodes

#### Step1. Install Netdata on each of the machines hosting your nodes as described in #### Step1 of "Set up the monitoring" part.

#### Step2. On Netdata Cloud click on the button `Connect Nodes`, and follow the instructions.

### Managing alerts

Netdata sets up alerts by default for some predefined metrics which may not fit your needs. You can set up personalized ones to be received automatically by email, Slack, or SMS.

#### How to reach config files?

Go to `/etc/netdata` and use the command `edit-config` to edit config files.

For example, to edit the cpu.conf health configuration file, run:

```bash
cd /etc/netdata
sudo ./edit_config health.d/cpu.conf
```

To list config files available just use ./edit-config command. Alert file names have this format: `health.d/file_name.conf`

(Configuration files are stored in `/usr/lib/netdata/conf.d` and alerts in `health.d` folder)

#### Manage existing alerts: Edit health configuration files

You can manage existing alerts by [editing health configuration file](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/monitor/configure-alarms#edit-health-configuration-files).

For example, here is the first health entity in `health.d/cpu.conf`:

```
template: 10min_cpu_usage #Name of the alarm/template.(required)
      on: system.cpu #The chart this alarm should attach to.(required)
      os: linux #Which operating systems to run this chart. (optional)
   hosts: * #Which hostnames will run this alarm.(optional)
  lookup: average -10m unaligned of user,system,softirq,irq,guest #The database lookup to find and process metrics for the chart specified through on.(required)
   units: %
   every: 1m #The frequency of the alarm.
   #"warn" and "crit" expressions evaluating to true or false, and when true, will trigger the alarm.
    warn: $this > (($status >= $WARNING)  ? (75) : (85)) 
    crit: $this > (($status == $CRITICAL) ? (85) : (95))
   delay: down 15m multiplier 1.5 max 1h #Optional hysteresis settings to prevent floods of notifications.
    info: average cpu utilization for the last 10 minutes (excluding iowait, nice and steal)
      to: sysadmin
```

[Here](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/health/reference#entity-format) is an exhaustive liste of alerts parameters.

#### Create personnalised alerts: Write a new health entity

To create personalised alerts, create a `.conf` file in `/usr/lib/netdata/conf.d/health.d` and edit this new file using the template shown previously:

As an example, here is a warning alert if the metric octez_p2p_connections_active is below 3 connections, and a critical alert if there are no connections at all (equal to 0):

```
alarm: tezos_node_p2p_connections_active (cannot be chart name, dimension name, family name, or chart variables names.)
      on: octez_p2p_connections_active
   hosts: * 
  lookup: average -10m unaligned of user,system,softirq,irq,guest 
    warn: $this<3
    crit: $this==0
    info:  "tezos_node_p2p_connections_actives" represents the current number of active p2p connections with your node.
      to: sysadmin
```

(You can access official Netdata documentation [here](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/monitor/configure-alarms#write-a-new-health-entity))


### Documentation on managing alerts

- [Basic documentation for configuring health alarms](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/monitor/configure-alarms)
- [Health configuration reference (detailed documentation)](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/health/reference)
- [Supported notification endpoints](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/monitor/enable-notifications#supported-notification-endpoints)


### Manage data retention

The metrics collected every second by Netdata can be stored in the local memory of your machine for a variable duration of time, depending on the desired history. This allows you to keep track of the activity of your node and to watch its evolution over time.

#### Get netdata.conf file

You can choose how long data will be stored on your local machine. To do so, you will need the `netdata.conf` file in the `/etc/netdata/` repository. If you haven't this file yet, you can download it using the following command:

```bash
wget -O /etc/netdata/netdata.conf http://localhost:19999/netdata.conf
```

You can view your current configuration at: `http://localhost:19999/netdata.conf`

#### Calculate the data base space needed

To calculate the space needed to store your metrics you will need:

- The time in seconds of how long time you want to keep the data
- The number of metrics (you can find it in your localhost dashboard as shown in the image below)
- The Tier of Netdata (by default 0).

For 2000 metrics, collected every second and retained for a month, Tier 0 needs: 1 byte x 2,000 metrics x 3,600 secs per hour x 24 hours per day x 30 days per month = 5,184MB.

![Number of metrics location in the dashboard](/developers/docs/images/monitor-a-node/number-of-metrics.jpeg)

#### Modify netdata.conf file

Now you just have to change the value of "dbengine multihost disk space" in [db] section in netdata.conf file by the value calculated before (in MB).

```
[db]
 dbengine multihost disk space MB =5184
 dbengine page cache size MB = 32
 # update every = 1
 # mode = dbengine
 # dbengine page cache with malloc = no
 # dbengine disk space MB = 256
 # memory deduplication (ksm) = yes
 # cleanup obsolete charts after secs = 3600
 # gap when lost iterations above = 1
 # storage tiers = 1
 # dbengine page fetch timeout secs = 3
 # dbengine page fetch retries = 3
 # dbengine page descriptors in file mapped memory = no
 # cleanup orphan hosts after secs = 3600
 # delete obsolete charts files = yes
 # delete orphan hosts files = yes
 # enable zero metrics = no
 # dbengine pages per extent = 64
```

## Full monitoring with Octez Metrics

Here is the global picture of a monitoring system, connecting all these tools together:

![](/developers/docs/images/monitor-a-node/all-in-all.png)

A Grafazos dashboard looks like this:

![](/developers/docs/images/monitor-a-node/octez-metrics-dashboard.gif)

Table 1: Grafana dashboard of a Tezos node

As you can immediately see at the top, the dashboard will tell you your node's bootstrap status and whether it's synchronized, followed by tables and graphs of other data points.


### Setting up Octez Metrics

To use Octez Metrics, you just start your node with the metrics server enabled. The node integrates a server that registers the implemented metrics and outputs them for each ``/metrics`` HTTP request.

When you start your node you add the ``--metrics-addr`` option which takes as a parameter ``<ADDR:PORT>`` or ``<ADDR>`` or ``:<PORT>``. This option can be used either when starting your node, or in the [configuration file](https://tezos.gitlab.io/user/node-configuration.html).

Your node is now ready to have metrics scraped with requests to the metrics server. For instance, if the node server is configured to expose metrics on port 9932 (the default), then you can scrape the metrics with the request ``http://localhost:9932/metrics``.
The result of the request is the list the node metrics described as:

```
#HELP metric description
#TYPE metric type
octez_metric_name{label_name=label_value} x.x
```

Note the metrics are implemented to have the lowest possible impact on the node performance, and most of the metrics are only computed when scraping it. So starting the node with the metrics server shouldn't be a cause for concern. More details on Octez Metrics can be found in the Tezos Developer Documentation: [see here](https://tezos.gitlab.io/user/node-monitoring.html) for further detail on how to setup your monitoring; and [here](https://tezos.gitlab.io/developer/openmetrics), for the complete list of the metrics scrapped by the Octez node.

### Types of metrics

The available metrics give a full overview of your node, including its characteristics, status, and health. In addition, they can give insight into whether an issue is local to your node, or it is affecting the network at large -- or both.

The metric `octez_version` delivers the node's main properties through label-value pairs. It provides the node version or the network it is connected to.

Other primary metrics you likely want to see are the *chain validator*[^1] ones, which describe the status of your node: `octez_validator_chain_is_bootstrapped` and `octez_validator_chain_synchronisation_status`. A healthy node should always have these values set to 1. You can also see information about the *head* and *requests* from the chain validator.

There are two other validators, the *block validator*[^2] and the *peer validator*[^3], which give you insight on how your node is handling the progression of the chain. You can learn more about the validators [here](https://tezos.gitlab.io/shell/validation.html)

To keep track of pending operations, you can check the `octez_mempool` metric.

You can get a view of your node's connections with the *p2p layer* metrics (prefixed with `octez_p2p`). These metrics allows you to keep track of the *connections*, *peers* and *points* of your node.

The [store](https://tezos.gitlab.io/shell/storage.html) can also be monitored with metrics on the save-point, checkpoint and caboose level, including the number of invalid blocks stored, the last written block size, and the last store merge time.

Finally, if you use the RPC server of your node, it is likely decisive in the operation of your node.
For each RPC called, two metrics are associated: `octez_rpc_calls_sum{endpoint="...";method="..."}` and `octez_rpc_calls_count{endpoint="...";method="..."}` (with appropriate label values). *call_sum* is the sum of the execution times, and *call_count* is the number of executions.

1. The chain validator is responsible for handling valid blocks and selecting the best head for its chain.
2. The block validator validates blocks and notifies the corresponding chain validator.
3. Each peer validator treats new head proposals from its associated peer, retrieving all the operations, and if valid, triggers a validation of the new head.

{% callout title="Octez version" %}
Note that the metrics described here are those available with Octez v14--it is likely to evolve with future Octez versions.
{% /callout %}

### Dashboards

While scraping metrics with server requests does give access to node metrics, it is, unfortunately, not enough for useful node monitoring. Since it only gives a single slice into the node's health, you don't really see what's happening over time. Therefore, a more useful way of monitoring your node is to create a time series of metrics.

Indeed, if you liked the poster, why not see the whole movie?

The [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) tool is designed for this purpose which collects metric data over time.

In addition, in order to get the most out of your metrics, it should be associated with a visual dashboard.
A [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboard, generated by [Grafazos](https://gitlab.com/nomadic-labs/grafazos) gives a greater view into your node. Once your node is launched, you can provide extracted time series of metrics to Grafana dashboards.

The Grafazos version for Octez v14 provides the following four ready-to-use dashboards:

- `octez-compact`: A compact dashboard that gives a brief overview of the various node metrics on a single page.
- `octez-basic`: A basic dashboard with all the node metrics.
- `octez-with-logs`: Same as basic but also displays the node's logs, with [Promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/) Promtail (for exporting the logs).
- `octez-full`: A full dashboard with the logs and hardware data. This dashboard should be used with [Netdata](https://www.netdata.cloud/) (for supporting hardware data) in addition to Promtail.

Note that the last two dashboards require the use of additional (though standard) tools for hardware metrics and logs (Netdata, Loki, and Promatail).

Let's look at the *basic* dashboard in more detail. The dashboard is divided into several panels. The first one is the *node panel*, which can be considered the main part of the dashboard. This panel lays out the core information on the node such as its status, characteristics, and statistics on the node's evolution (head level, validation time, operations, invalid blocks, etc.).

The others panels are specific to different parts of the node:

- the p2p layer;
- the workers;
- the RPC server;

along with a miscellaneous section.

Some metrics are self-explanatory, such as *P2P total connections*, which shows both the connections your node initiated and the number of connections initiated by peers. Another metric you may want to keep an eye on is *Invalid blocks history*, which should always be 0 -- any other value would indicate something unusual or malicious is going on.

Another useful metric is the *Block validation time*, which measures the time between when a request is registered in the worker till the worker pops the request and marks it complete. This should generally be under 1 second. If it's persistently longer, that could indicate trouble too.

![](/developers/docs/images/monitor-a-node/metrics-block-validation-time.png)

Graph 2: Block validation time


The *P2P connections* graph will show you immediately if your node is having trouble connecting to peers, or if there's a drop-off in the number of connections.
A healthy node should typically have a few dozen peer connections (depending on how it was configured).


![](/developers/docs/images/monitor-a-node/metrics-p2p-connections.png)

Graph 3: P2P connections

The *Peer validator* graph shows a number of different metrics including *unavailable protocols*. An up-to-date, healthy node should see this as a low number. If not it can indicate that your node is running an old version of Octez, or that your node is being fed bad data from peers.

*Note again these dashboards are built for Octez v14 and are likely to evolve with the Octez versions*.

### Working with Grafazos

Grafazos allows you to set different options when generating the ready-to-use dashboards described above. For instance, you can specify the ``node instance label``, which is useful for a dashboard that aims to monitor several nodes.

Furthermore, you can manually explore the metrics from the Prometheus data source with Grafana and design your own dashboards.
Or you can also use Grafazos to import ready-to-use dashboards for your node monitoring. You can find the packages stored [here](https://gitlab.com/nomadic-labs/grafazos/-/packages). There is a package for each version of Octez.

Grafana is a relatively user-friendly tool, so play with creating a custom one as you like. You may also want to use the "explore" section of Grafana. Grafazos is also particularly useful in automatic deployment of Tezos nodes via provisioning tools such as Puppet or Ansible.

## Conclusion

Octez Metrics gives Tezos users insight into how their node is performing, and ability to observe the overall network health. The best way to keep your node healthy and keep the entire Tezos network healthy is with monitoring tools to gain insite into network health.
