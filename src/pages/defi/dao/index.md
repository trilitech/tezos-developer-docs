A DAO is an organization that uses open-source smart contract codes to automate and facilitate decision-making.
Using a DAO may help prevent human error or manipulation since the decision power is no longer in the hands of a few trusted people. Rather, it is automated distributively and written as an immutable code deployed on the blockchain.
Using a DAO is not risk-free: Recall [the DAO project where coding errors led to \$50 million of funds being lost](https://www.coindesk.com/understanding-dao-hack-journalists).
